I was engaged throughout and definitely enjoyed my time spent reading it.I loved the character development in this novel.  Da Silva creates a cast of high school students who actually act like high school students.  I really appreciated the fact that none of them were thrown into situations far beyond their years, nor did they deal with events as if they had decades of life experience under their belts.  It was very refreshing and added to the realism and impact of the novel.  The friendships between the characters in this novel were also truly touching.Overall, this novel was fantastic.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more and to find out what happens next in the series.  I&#8217;d definitely recommend this debut novel by Da Silva to those who want a little YA fun with a completely unique & shocking storyline.Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review.\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"An amazing first novel\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1396137600, \"reviewTime\": \"03 30, 2014\"}\n\nNEGATIVE\n999\n",

A certain mindset. It talks about being fearful of sleep paralysis and how meditation plus lucid dreaming helps to archive astral travel.The reason I'm giving it a 1 star is because the most critical element, according to the book, to actually being able to project, requires  &#34;sleep paralysis&#34;, and the book spends almost no time at all on how to achieve it.Here's a section on sleep paralysis:&#34;Is there a way to activate or consciously create sleep paralysis? I haven&#8217;t found a way to consciously induce it, however, there are several conditions which almost always lead to sleep paralysis. One is being on your back. Another is coming out of a lucid dream. And the third is taking a nap or going back to sleep in the middle of the night after you&#8217;ve been up for a short while.&#34;Here's the passage indicating that sleep paralysis is critical to the process of astral projection:&#34;The big moment has arrived. You&#8217;ve achieved sleep paralysis, your body is tingling, you hear the buzzing high-pitched sound of acceleration. You can see even though your eyes are closed, you&#8217;re sensing, seeing, and hearing other beings around you. Your astral body is activated&#34;In other words, without sleep paralysis I cannot astral project, and the book really doesn't spend any time on how to get me there. This was not helpful for me.

Let speechless at times and wanting to cry out loud I enjoyed the ride.Eden has hit on a theme that takes a lot to work with, Blake is a recovering addict and Gabi is his strength. I absolutely LOVED how Eden wrote how they first *meet* its so well written you feel like you are there witnessing it.Gabi has had her fair share of heartache in her life to and is slowly building her life up again. Her character is written in a way so that you would just love to be her best friend, but she doesn&#8217;t let to many people close.There is so much more to Blake than the loud mouth jokester he portrays himself as. I felt for him and the way his character was written was so well done.I am really looking forward to seeing the guys in the next book, Eden has a winner with this serious, I just can&#8217;t get enough!Highly Recommended', \"Loved this second book as much as the first.Taz wow.Some MC books are so repetitious of others,but this one had everything.Like a series that has the same characters coming back in all the books.Wonder about Elle though,she does not seem like the typical MC presidents ole lady.Don't think I like her character.But not much about her in this one.Who's next in the series?Will definitely read it.\", 'I really love the Invisibles series.

And you'll feel the sensation all over again. Oh, and the steamy scenes were hot!\", \"All God's Children was a bit of a different take on WWII historical fiction. Instead of the usual ultra-brave heroine and hero fighting against the evil Nazis in any way they can; we have Beth, a Quaker pacifist, and Josef, a doctor in the German army who happens to believe in the Germany he remembers from childhood.After reading several WWII fiction books that mostly center in the U.S., England, or France, it was nice to read a slightly different view of things in Germany and of the many German's that fought against Hitler's regime in a myriad of ways.One of the fascinating things about the book is all of the Quaker beliefs and methods that are key to the story and how certain characters act. I knew almost nothing about the Society Of Friends, they are a little-written-about group, and so the fact that this story centers around a Quaker girl and some of her family and friends made this story even more interesting for me.The author does an excellent job of immersing the reader in WWII era Munich. I could see everything so clearly in my mind's eye. I felt like I was walking the streets of the city with Beth and Josef, stepping inside the apartment with Uncle Franz and Aunt Ilse, hiding in the basement from falling bombs with Liesl.The last third of the book did seem a bit hurried to me, causing the historical detail and character emotions to take a little dip.That aside, All God's Children was very enjoyable and I will definitely be looking forward to the release of the next book in this series, Simple Faith.The combination of setting the story in a  little used WWII location, the Quaker pacifism, (old) German patriotism, detail in locations, interesting characters, and just the history, make this a great book for lovers of Historical fiction.(I received a copy of this book from the publisher through The Book Club Network in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own)\", 'This book provides excellent insight into measurable and effective means to evaluate yourself and gives good relationship advice abound information to work through and evaluate a relationship a narcissistic partner relationship.

As anyone who has gone to college knows, this is an all too familiar pattern and I feel that many people can relate to Victoria Gardner&#8217;s weight problem and will benefit from hearing about her success with Volumetrics. Gardner writes with a mix of humor and charm that makes her story appealing. I also like the fact that not only did Gardner change her eating habits; she also included exercise in her diet plan - two things that all doctors recommend. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking into diet plans and want one that doesn't involve depriving yourself of certain foods.\", \"I recommend this book to anyone who wants non-stop suspense. My rating is personal,because I don't like non-stop suspense.  I'll still try the next book in this series and hope it isn't quite so tense. I know there's a lot of bad people in this world.

I read for entertainment and don't find psychos enjoyable.\", 'Wow this series blowed me away I loved it man the author hit this one right on the money', 'Broken is the debut novel by K.Webster and it is HOT! From the moment I started this book I did not want to put it down. The characters of Andi and Jackson are so deliriously sexy you can&#8217;t help but to root for them the whole way through! This book is full of fun, drama and super steamy!This book is about how two people who are distancing themselves from even the remote possibility of love can change if the right person comes along!Andi is young and beautiful but her once sense of hope at a happily ever after has been lost. After she caught her fiance cheating, her whole outlook on love changed. After regaining control of her emotions, Andi decided never to let a man hurt her like that again. Now, Andi plays a game . . . the kind that keeps her heart safe but her needs met. Andi keeps men for one weekend, 3 days, of fun and excitement then she is done. She gets all the fun she wants with no commitment and no disappointment. Then Jackson happened . . .Jackson is rich. successful, handsome and oozes sex! But, Jackson comes with his own personal relationship drama that has left him scared too. When he hears Andi offering her game up to a stranger in a bar he decided to play along. He is completely down for a weekend of fun with no emotional attachment at the end. The weekend started out super hot right from the start in the club office . . .But it does not take long into their 3 days for you to be able to tell that what they are feeling is more than sex. When the weekend ends and they part ways you desperately want more for them. When life throws them back together can they get past their past baggage and work on their present?This whole book had me enthralled. I loved watching these two characters develop both individually and together. The flashbacks from their darker days really helped shape the characters for me and gave me great insight into why they handled things the way that they did. I though that K. Webster did a phenomenal job at producing a strong debut and I cannot wait for the other two books in this series!', 'Have not been disappointed with a robin Carr book yet and I love the series books.

While I LOVED LOVED The Coincidence of Callie and Kayden, The Redemption for me was heavy and intense. This couple had a lot to work through namely Callie trying to save Kayden as he has done for her. What I appreciated the most from this story was Callie&#8217;s strength to not give up on her love for Kayden. This girl proved to me time and time again how far she has come since book 1 &#8211; all because of Kayden. And this book was her returning the favor and never giving up on the hope and faith of their love.When Kayden begins to finally open up to Callie again &#8211; it&#8217;s like a breath of fresh air and I am sighing with relief because I am seeing a sliver of hope for that boy we once knew in The Coincidence. Kayden loved her so much and it destroyed me to see him push her away, feeling that he was not worthy. Together they are pieces of a missing puzzle and my world feels complete and full. Seeing Kayden feel and understand this love that is given to him so freely is beautiful.What made my heart soar was watching them both face their pasts head-on and together. As we all know, confronting your demons and your past is a hard thing to do but when you have love at your side anything is possible.This was a beautiful story of hope, healing and acceptance. Both characters who were so emotionally broken, being able to recognize their soul mate within each other and finally moving forward to a life and love that they both deserve together was simply beautiful! Love this couple! &#60;3', \"I bought this as a gift for a five-year-old. Simple rhyming poetry, delightful graphics. There is though a sense of overkill in the number of toys in the room, which a lot of children do not have and probably shouldn't have. I think it sends a dubious message of excess. I don't think I would buy anymore of this series.\", 'Three Weeks With Lady X is Eloisa James at the top of her game! I loved this book from beginning to end! One thing I find particularly appealing about Eloisa James is her uncanny ability to describe a person, not just their looks but their feelings as well and in this book she did not disappoint. Her description of India\\'s reaction to a particularly condescending marriage proposal is a case in point, \"Aggravation marched up her spine like a troop of perfectly dressed soldiers.\"Both India and Thorn are strong characters, exceptionally good at what they do and accustomed to being in command, so when they get together sparks fly. A particularly witty exchange of letters early in the book in which neither backs down but both clearly enjoy the correspondence hints at the relationship to come. Despite their strength of character and despite their stubbornness both India and Thorn are vulnerable, largely due to difficult childhoods yet it is those hard starts to life that have shaped them into what they are. It is those vulnerabilities that made me warm to them.I found this book hard to put down. I found myself sneaking a few chapters when I woke in the middle of the night and struggling to stay awake so I could reach the end, yet also wanting to carry on living with the characters, and I guess that\\'s the mark of a good book. Well done Eloisa James! another gem!', \"I'm glad the story of Santini boys parents was told. It shows the strength of the basis of the core of a family.\", 'It was good....there is a lot going on with multiple characters, I guess setting up for the whole series and introducing the upcoming leading Duchesses.', 'In A Chain of Thunder, Jeff Shaara continues his series on the War in the West bringing us the campaign which opened the Mississippi and introduces us to some very interesting characters.  Through his usual narrative, there comes some clarity which has left Civil War novices confused about the Vicksburg Campaign and the novel stands as a great introduction for those people interested in something besides the War in the East.  The second part of his series is a welcome addition not only to the bookshelves of Civil War buffs, but the literary world as well.Jeff Shaara is a New York Times bestseller and began his career with the work preceding his father&#8217;s called Gods and Generals and finished the story with The Last Full Measure.  Shaara has won numerous accolades for his works on the revolution called Rise to Rebellion and The Glorious Cause.  After his series on the Civil War in the West, he will be pursuing the Texas conflict and the Korean War.For the first time in his career, Jeff Shaara has given us the outlook of a woman.  She does not have just one chapter, but many telling the story of the civilians who had to hide out in the caves and sometimes gave their services as nurses.  The narrative of the hospitals is gruesome and not for the faint of heart, but even more so, the narrative of life in the caves is even worse.  There are some points in literature which stick with you for the rest of your life and his description of life in the caves and the starvation of the men and women of the city of Vicksburg is one of those passages.  Whether it be the slaughter of the horses so they could eat all the way down to killing dogs for food, the disturbing image comes when there is no reservation about eating these animals.  Even the conditions of the high command of the Confederate army is deplorable.  In this volume, Shaara chooses to use Pemberton as the voice of the Confederate command structure instead of Johnston and rightfully so.  Pemberton was more the defender of Vicksburg than any other commander.  He does, however, give Pemberton the same treatment his father gave Longstreet in The Killer Angels.  He has taken a character which was not always in good light and given him a favorable view.  In the end, you feel sorry for Pemberton and wonder what he could have done to further his fight.  But knowing there was nothing for him to do was quite sad and some say could change the opinions of people about the man.  On the Union side,  we have the regulars from the last book, A Blaze of Glory, with Private Bauer from the 17th Wisconsin and General Sherman.  Something, however, can be said about reading a book with the opposition has the upper hand constantly in the campaign.  While there are small battles throughout the siege which the Union army loses, there is something in the back of the reader&#8217;s mind saying that they still have the upper hand in the situation which makes this book a bit more history than novel.  Which brings me to the major point of my review.  A Chain of Thunder is a good book, but is more nonfiction novel than an actual historical fiction book.  I learned more about the Vicksburg Campaign in this book than I have learned from any of his other works and once again, Shaara shines when he only has to worry about a single campaign or battle instead of stretching the work over a few years.I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction because while being such, it is quite different from what the standard is for those types of works.  The detail in which is gives to the campaign of Vicksburg is quite good and while he makes the reader feel sympathy for the Confederate army, there is still an even divide between the Union and Confederate accounts.  Jeff Shaara&#8217;s War in the West series is a very welcome addition to my own Civil War library and should be a welcome addition to any other history fan as well.Matthew Bartlett - Author, Gettysburg Chronicle', 'This was an easy read and it was fun to read. Kept me wanting to keep reading it not put it down.', \"MY REVIEW:Grand Central Publishing|May 6, 2014|Trade Paperback|ISBN: 978-1-4555-5433-1Still grieving the death of her prematurely delivered infant, Lila finds a welcome distraction in renovating a country house she's recently inherited.  Surrounded by blueprints and plaster dust, though, she finds herself drawn into the story of a group of idealistic university grads from thirty years before, who'd thrown off the shackles of bourgeois city life to claim the cottage and rely only on each other on the land.  But utopia-building can be fraught with unexpected peril, and when the fate of the group is left eerily unclear, Lila turns her attention to untangling a web of secrets to uncover the shocking truth of what happened that fateful year, in order to come to terms with her own loss and build a new future for herself.I was literally glued to the pages of this book.  I just couldn't take my eyes off the pages for even a second.  The story was solid, the characters well fleshed out and original and the surprises just kept coming.  I was literally rocked off my feet by the ending and had no idea what was coming as I was nearing the end.  I think shock is even a mild word to describe the end, I didn't see, nor even considered this ending.  What a powerful punch this story delivered.  Hannah Richell has certainly penned a winner with THE SHADOW YEAR!\", 'this book is strange i wouldnt recommend this book to kids under the age of 11 too much of reality', \"Seriously...

But I just knew the story. As someone who formerly worked in law enforcement and is involved with victim rights, it really caught my eye. This is something everyone should read. The bravery of Officer Busby in the moments and then years after the crime is amazing. His daughter, Cylin, is a wonderful writer of her own accord and she recounts these events that had such an impact on their lives very well. Buy this book and read it. You won't be disappointed.\", 'I really enjoyed reading this book by Carl Reiner reflecting on his life.  What a fabulous human being!  What a great life!', 'Not my type of mystery. Was able to determine \"who done it\" at onset of mystery.  Not enough tension between possible love interests and other romantic option (Chris and Craig) was pretty weird.

He provides a clear and concise methodology for connecting the mind into the meridian channels and acupuncture points. His techniques for dredging the channels, although simple, are remarkably wonderful. I couldn't be happier to have picked this one up. Thanks!\", \"The Rithmatist is a thinking reader's epic fantasy. It's focus on geometric patterns will appeal to budding engineers, mathematicians and architects, and the strong emphasis on battle strategy will appeal to fans of strategy games.  Other than that, The Rithmatist is a pretty formulaic YA fantasy. Protagonist, Joel, is in a permanent funk because he cannot study to become a rithmatist. His only friend, Melody, is despondent because her family legacy makes her feel she must become a rithmatist, and she doesn't want to be one. Author, Brandon Sanderson, is famous for his creative vision of magic and his infusion of magic in his stories, and this true in The Rithmatist. The mythology around the magical 2D creatures is almost a bigger part of the story than the events of the rising action.  Luckily, the last third of the novel all elements come together for a nail-biting, scary crisis and climax. The ending is a little too predictable, but is a perfect set-up for the sequels.\", \"This book had too many plots with sub-plots........that had sub-plots....that had sub-plots........I could read 2 chapters and then that was usually enough to put me to sleep.  Too many words needed to tie all of the plots together.  Concentrate on two or three plots and expand those stories, don't jump around.  This author needs to learn to concentrate on one theme (not eight)\", 'I love this story. This book is very unique and the students in my class love to read this book.', 'A dangerous manuscript, a literary agent, the CIA, Zurich, and Copenhagen. The perfect set-up for a thriller&#8212;crack for readers. And it only got better once I started the book.At the beginning, I was concerned with the plethora of characters and viewpoints, which often turns a novel into a confusion of characters where you have to turn back to earlier chapters to remember who is who. But Chris Pavone does a great job of making each character memorable enough to keep straight.It is the choices of these characters that drive an intricate plot, which unwinds in a frenetic twenty-four hour period. Not only are the plot and characters well-written, the writing itself is clean and free of the clich&eacute;s that often find their way into thrillers.The Accident is a perfect weekend read or, in my case, excellent treadmill reading.

I honestly like it more than the Hunger Games which is saying alot. In this installment, you really get to see the anatomy of the relationship between Tris and Four, while also being privy to a wonderful story with twists and turns that you really don't see coming. I would HIGHLY recommend reading Divergent first, as is mostly the case you can't really appreciate the second if you haven't read the first.\", 'I got a lot out of this book.

Dr Morgan Sierra wears a stone on a thong around her neck, as does her sister. When her sister and niece are kidnapped, Morgan is told she must collect 10 other stones, called the Pentecost stones, from around the world to save them. These stones, one for each Apostle, were originally carved from the stone that closed Jesus' tomb. I was impressed by the meticulous research into the lives of the original apostles and I liked the feeling of authenticity in the scene settings. In this day and age of faltering belief, this is a good book to read even if it is fiction.\", \"Repetitive. The entire 2nd book is basically the exact same thing as the 1st book.

Nothing earth shattering, but an enjoyable, casual read..  I also bought the audible versions so I could listen on the go.  Got to the 3rd book and ... it isn't complete - I mean, it just ... stops.  So basically, you get 2 stories that are pretty decent then a longish series of chapters with an author's note at the end that there is more to come (after you shell out more $$ of course.)  If you want resolutions to a number of plot lines, you have buy book 4.  There doesn't seem to be an expected date for that installment.I expect, at this price ($23 + audio), to find a beginning, middle and end to EACH book, not a bait and switch for the next installment.  This made me so mad that I returned the book to Amazon - which I have never done before. I say steer clear - very poorly done.\", 'A wonderful description of life in the 1960s for a young teen and his family.

I agree with another reviewer that the names are a little crazy and I did struggle with those at first, but then again Chewbacca was a strange name too and we now all know that.  Princess Sitnalta is a very sweet and noble character and the story has many classic fairytale/fantasy situations but the ending is unique and the story was just fun and refreshing.', 'This book takes me back to my growing up years in Michigan.

As an older woman, 60+, I will always be a bit shocked at the explicit sex scenes in romance novels, however, this book has a story that is deep and moving which holds you right down to the last sentence. I loved the humor that was infused throughout the book. I laughed out loud, and shed a few tears. (not the norm for me, especially the laughter) The author was able to give me a book that I didn\\'t want to put down until I finished, and what truly surprised me was that I enjoyed reading it a second and third time, normally, I am not one to even watch a movie twice. (I did that as a beta reader to give the best feedback that I could, but really enjoyed it each time discovering nuances in the story that I\\'d missed the time before.) I would recommend this book to lovers of Romance Novels who enjoy story lines like Nicholas Sparks has written and aren\\'t turned-off by a bit of the \"Fifty-shades\" explicitness.

Her word pictures transport me right to where she wants me to be, like a fly on the wall, privy to everyone's thoughts & feelings.

Now I just get the next book & I'm part of the neighborhood again!I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance, including teenagers. You can be sure this book is full of, dare I say it?, old fashioned family values liberally sprinkled with God's involvement in our daily lives.

The amount of historical detail that she works seamlessly into the plot is beautiful. And she treats all of her Indian characters as people, rather than stereotypes. (I want a book about Catches Bears!).There was never a moment that I felt jerked from the story, instead it seemed like I was there with the characters. I could perfectly see the forest with all of the animals and the people. The story of Franklin was one that I had heard of before, but she brought to life.My one complaint was that the story seemed to a little too perfectly, with every single thread tide up, even those that I had not realized were loose. While I like happy endings, it was somewhat too perfect. Not that it will stop anyone from loving this story.I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\", 'Her writing drove me crazy, with all the parentheses on almost every page, and the \"thoughts\" all the characters said was also distracting.

I didn't realize the author was a Perry Mason fan until after I read the book and you can see Perry Mason in how the character deduces who did what.  There are too many people murdered and too many psychos for such a small town but you continue to stumble along with Josh as he finally figures out who killed whom.

Hopefully it comes out before the summer (hint, hint).\", \"After all the evidence is in, it appears that some Hemings' descendants are related to some descendants of the Jefferson family, possibly Thomas Jefferson, or some other Jefferson. That's as far as science can take us.  From that, Gordon-Reed takes bits and  pieces of folklore to create a glorified and highly exaggerated image of Sally Hemings.  Even if Jefferson fathered Hemings' children, one should not make too much of it. When his wife died, Jefferson was still a relatively young man, with powerful needs. It would not be unreasonable for a man to use one of his slaves to relieve himself, any more than it would be unreasonable for him to use a prostitute. By many contemporaneous accounts, Hemings had sexual intercourse with many men on the bustling, but cloistered, Monticello estate. Powerful men have powerful needs and weaknesses. Even so, this does not elevate Hemings to the level of having a serious, significant relationship with Jefferson, any more than Bill Clinton's dalliances are serious relationships. The Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemings' bastards, if they exist, were nothing more than the product of  a sexual relationship of convenience. The book is worth reading, though, because Gordon-Reed does gather together in one place a great deal of Jefferson folklore, even if some of her conclusions are flawed.\", 'I had never read Ella Frank before and wasn&#8217;t even sure what to think when reading the synopsis.. After reading it, I don&#8217;t think the blurb does it justice. This book felt like it was written as an erotic suspense with lots of twists and turns. I was gripped by the story from the beginning and could not put it down. I think it should have been said that this is a student/teacher romance. BUT don&#8217;t allow preconceived notions to let that turn you off&#8230;. trust me, this isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re thinking. This book wasn&#8217;t what I was expecting and I couldn&#8217;t be happier about it.In the beginning, we meet Addison (Addy) and it&#8217;s pretty clear she is in a mental institution. Her doctor &#8220;Doc&#8221; is trying to get her to talk and she seems to be in some kind of psychosis where she won&#8217;t speak. I was really excited that the book just throws you off the cliff and you have to try and figure out what is happening. From the beginning all you know is that something is wrong and you want to know how she got there. The most intriguing part of the beginning of the book is that Addy keeps thinking she&#8217;s alone and &#8220;he&#8221; is gone. The first three chapters of this book set an amazing tone of the story that follows. Addy was a dark and sexual character to get inside. I was captivated by her maturity even though she was young. I loved how she was so bold and not embarrassed by her body or her desires.Mr. McKendrick wasn&#8217;t at all what I was expecting. When someone says student/teacher romance I immediately think the guy is going to be a sleazy creep. I assume he is preying on an innocent girl or taking advantage of a vulnerability. I can honestly say those thoughts NEVER crossed my mind with him. I felt like from the beginning he was trying to thwart Addy&#8217;s advances. He was very clear that she was his student and it wasn&#8217;t going to happen. He kept his distance and told her &#8220;no&#8221; repeatedly. I loved that he wasn&#8217;t your typical guy looking for a young piece of a**. He was a man, who&#8217;s heart connected to Addy&#8217;s. I fell in love with Mr. McKendrick and I am not even the least bit ashamed. He does reveal his first name in the book, but it&#8217;s such an intimate scene I&#8217;ll let you find that out on your own.I am not even a little sorry at how much this book turned me on. I think I even said I was going to make my husband tell me &#8220;no&#8221; over and over again after I finished this book. I have never been so turned on in my life by a man trying to stop a woman&#8217;s sexual advances. The tease, the build up, and the sex are 5 of 5 stars. My vagina and I were totally in agreement that this book was a sexual beast.For me, this book was an A. The story was suspenseful and captivating and I couldn&#8217;t stop reading. I was wrapped in the mystery of what happened to Addy and why Mr. McKendrick was missing. I didn&#8217;t see how this book was going to play out from the beginning, so I loved that it kept me on edge. I read this book in a day and was angry at myself for finishing it so fast. I don&#8217;t know about the author&#8217;s other books, but this blew me away. If you are looking for book that has a lot of heat, and a bit of a thriller aspect to it, then this is it! Loved it from beginning to end.', \"Theresa's explanation of life on the other side is the best I have ever read.

It's clear Paul is totally besotted by Judith, but when Kate and Paul get stranded at his family's ski lodge during a blizzard--a storm so severe that James and Judith cannot make it there as planned, Kate and Paul see each other in a new light. But...Paul is tied to Judith and Kate is tied to James. How can they find happiness together with their best friend/brother in the place they want to be.

The guardian angel was variously portrayed as being ignorant of modern culture and language and quite familiar with slang and technology. I think the book would have just as good without &#34;pea brain.&#34; The book needed an editor badly. The mystery storyline was a little weak and I really got tired of the &#34;aging hippie&#34; descriptions. I would like to read another book by this author to see if the writing or editing improves.', \"I tried this book on the strength of the author's previous book, Behind the Green Curtain.  I liked this one as well, and although they are two very different books, I have similar things to say about this one, which is that I enjoy her writing but am not really a fan of her plot twists.  This book has two plot twists; the first one takes place about halfway through and is fine, but the second one takes place in the final pages of the book and I could have done without it.  For a moment, it felt like the rug was pulled out from under me, and although the author put it back, it was rather jolting.  I think things could have accomplished it in a different way.  Having said that, her story flows, the characters are interesting, there is some humor, and  I like her analogies and imagery.\", \"It's In Your Hands is a great book about motivating yourself to achieve goals. The book helps the reader to reach those goals by giving examples and detailing what is needed in order to achieve success.

I needed to find something that would pick me up and give me more out of books. i fell in love with Kylie scott and A Stage Dive novel books. i found myself laughing outloud and couldnt stop !', \"So, I loved the early IAD books. Kresley Cole is capable of telling a great story filled with humor, action, and romance. That said...1. I had put off reading this book due to the book price coinciding with hardcover price. If I had paid HC price for this, it would have been a 1.2. I know the hero was tortured and all but he heaped abuse on the heroine. Paranormal elements aside, if she were a friend, I'd subtly be showing her how unhealthy the relationship is and trying to convince her to end it.3. This book doesn't the have the laugh-out-loud moments and one-liners that previous ones did.4. I'm afraid this series is in decline.  We're moving the grand plot along by pushing out meh stories. This happens I guess--I've actually thought the same about another paranormal series I follow. I wish the authors would quit while ahead and leave us with good memories of good books with good characters.I do hope KC keeps writing. Maybe she can recreate her special brand of magic in a new project. I haven't read her YA series yet. Now, I have mixed feelings about starting on that.\", \"I was pretty disappointed in the writing - I could do better.

I feel like the last two books and the next one could be combined into one novel. I look forward to each new book, but I feel like  the should be more substantial for the money.', 'Not one of my favorite Stephen King novels but it was an interesting read.  I was expecting a more exciting ending but it seems he got bored and just threw together an ending.', 'was very pleased with the story -you get so involved you think it&#34;s real. can hardly wait to read the next series that continues with the same characters in the sunrise edition', \"This is the third book in the series and my favorite so far.

LOVE the main 2 characters. Not your typical heroes. I simply could not put any of these books down. 5 star, 2 thumbs up and highly recommend this entire series. It starts out different from the get go and I normally dont like that. I am old school and usually like your run of the mill zombie story. This has changed my mind.

Every time me and my family move it seems like we have more &#34;stuff&#34;. Our home always begins to feel cramped over time and we move thinking it will solve the problem. This book has helped us figure out ways of cutting down on the clutter and condensing the stuff we have to a much more manageable level. I never knew where to begin so would just give up on minimizing the clutter, and instead would just want to move again to a bigger place. We now do not have to move again! We have finally found a sure fire way to maximize our space, and it has made our stress levels plummet! I didn't even realize that the source of our stress was the clutter everywhere.

The characters of the story was designed very well and was executed amazingly  and came out strongly. I really loved reading fiction books, and i would highly recommend this book!!!!!', 'Now I know what the Dow is but I had not heard of the Dow Theory which kind of sparked my interest in checking out this book. The theory is actually just based on 3 theories which is explained in this book. This theory being completely new and unheard of to me, I really liked how each assumption was clearly written out on a level that anyone could understand.  The book used a lot of comparisons to really get the point across and a little bit of history was brought in the mix so you could really see where it all started.  As with most theories and information on stocks and trading, the dow theory is heavily concentrated on recognizing, analyzing, and being aware of trends. The Dow Theory is definitely another weapon to use in your stock market strategy. I feel that if I become more familiar with it I can use it to my advantage allowing me to pay attention and use the facts over popular assumptions that are easy to follow.', \"Finally jumped on the fifty shades bandwagon. Was a good book and a fun and quick read. Finished in two days, but I also had jury duty on one of those days. Seems most people have missed the point of this book. Is not just about s&m desires and dom/sub role play. There is a love story hidden in there, disguised as obsession and possession in the only way damaged people sometimes love until they learn about trust. Looking forwad to the next part of the trilogy. Not overly sexual, though does deal in many aspects of lust, heavy references to genitalia throughout, many references to alternative lifestyle including what some may consider consentual abuse more psychologically harmful than physically to the characters. Not for tweens or teens. More adult subject matter. I didn't personally find anything offensive, but I also know how to keep an open mind about books/movies, etc.\", 'Awesome series!!!!!!!!!  Great job by the author of this series.  So much suspense and action with so many twist and turns.  Loved the characters and the story.  Buy the series.  It will not disappoint you.  Be prepared to lose some sleep cause you will not be able to put the book down.', 'Buy this and your emotions will take over!  I was not able to stop reading until I completed the book.', \"The author says he is both a scientist and a spiritual seeker. Judging by this book he is 90% scientist and only 10% spiritual seeker. The only reason he gives for rejecting the materialist world view is that it is depressing and renders life meaningless. That's a good reason to be a spiritual seeker, but does not provide evidence for a different world view.The author believes life is meaningless without a belief in life in after death, so he writes about paranormal phenomena, OBEs, NDEs, and so forth. The problem is that he presents no compelling evidence for these things. His scientific side requires him to hedge and examine evidence for spiritual phenomena from a skeptical viewpoint. The author treats telekinesis, clairvoyance, telepathy, remote viewing, OBEs, NDEs, and so forth. But after examining the &#34;evidence&#34; in light if the author's scientific &#34;weasel words,&#34; you are less likely to believe in these things than to accept them as real. Even the author's single so-called PSI experience is very weak and unconvincing.The author states that &#34;after death contacts&#34; would provide the most compelling evidence for an afterlife, and then writes a chapter that concludes not only that there is NO evidence for such, but it is just too hard to study &#34;scientifically.&#34; The theme runs throughout the book that science has led us astray, yet we have no choice but to use the scientific method to set us back on the right path. As a practicing scientist with a reputation to uphold, the author attempts to both criticize science and appease his colleagues at the same time. How can the author believe that science is at once the problem AND the solution?The author's message boils down to this: &#34;I want to believe in an afterlife, and in spite of the lack of evidence I WILL believe because the alternative is too depressing (meanwhile, I will look forward to the day when science gives me a good reason to believe)..\", 'Thoroughly enjoyed this Lei Crime Companion novel about Marcella.

Not your typical Baldacci book, but this one stood out a lot also.  Glad to have tried it', 'What I know about Julius Caesar before reading this book is close to nothing but after reaching the last chapter of the book, I knew of his complete (and quite long) name and more. I particularly liked the life lessons of Julius Caesar as it specifically makes the reader feel that big things are achievable and it gives a reader the impression that Caesar is an ordinary man. I just wish that the chapters retelling the life of Caesar were relayed in an engaging and creative manner.', 'A lot of humor intended or not.  The bad guys were like the three stories.

This is one of my books of the year.An incredibly well written book that draws you in to Jonah's story of being a Master.  He is dominant, confident and articulate without being arrogant.  He is thoughtful but speaks his mind and has an understanding of women that just screams wow off the page at you.In telling his story in this way, we get to see his very thoughtful insights into how he views his role as a Master.  He is a Master that thrives on deriving pleasure from the women who submit to him.Leticia's character grows in confidence as his story unfolds and she becomes bolder with him in a subtle way.  The way that their relationship grows and develops is not in your face but done with subtle nuances.And wow!! The ending was not what I expected - it was so much better than the very predictable endings that we see in pretty much every other book in this genre.  I like the unpredictability of it and together two very well developed and likeable characters in Jonah and Leticia.

Then you keep trying to find what you're looking for only to realize a potential partner needs to see that you are what they're looking for. Baby Girl addresses that issue in this couple. Are they normal for what they like in their relationship? Is there potential for a future? Scott Hildreth takes you on that journey of a different type of relationship. Can a woman give herself over to a demanding man? In a time when women are supposed to be very independent? Baby Girl is a psychological quest for answers. As our main couple takes this journey together will they reach their ever after? Will it be happy? I am anxious to continue this journey with them. I was extremely and pleasantly surprised this was not an average alpha meets his submissive bed pal. It made you think. I could not just read it fast. There are no filler words in this story.

I got the message that quitting sugar is hard, but I wanted more solutions to breaking the cycle. Perhaps I was again looking for the easy solution. In fact there is no easy way to lose weight. Other diets have proven that carb restriction usually suppresses cravings and the weight loss and health benefits have been widely publicized. I just didn't see much new in this approach.

It starts out with Kate being chased by men and Ethan saving her and helping her look for his brother. She doesn't trust him due to what his brother said. The men chasing didn't stop there, they turn up every time you turn around, throw in a few Indian children, a wild wolf, ghost, spirits and a few other things and you have a great read. You find yourself pulled into the story, looking for the brother who is looking for gold, but really wanting to find the father, seems everyone is looking for Ethan brother but not all for the same reason.There is all the romance you could ask for, the good and the bad along with the sad, throw in a little humor and you have a good read. Kate finds out a few things about Ethan's past that she doesn't know if she can forget much less forgive. To find the answers you will have to read the book. I promise you will not be disappointed.\", 'Haunting and very realistic! I can see how this could happen to any of us.

Ended too soon and begged for more.\", 'Brilliantly Written!  Epic!Awesomeness is not a good enough word to describe this brilliantly written story &#8211; No I think Epic would sum it up nicely.  This captivating story is filled with a humorous seductive romance that kept me glued to the pages and wanting to live in their world forever.  The author&#8217;s descriptive details of the Highlander&#8217;s country side and their clan&#8217;s leaves the reader with a breathtaking vision that will forever be melded into your heart.  The character&#8217;s chemistry and humorous banter will forever have you longing for more of their story.Edmund MacGregor is a man of his word and beliefs.  God-like example of David & Goliath, the metaphor is clearly a Highlander conquering and ending the Giants of Aristocratic Nobility&#8217;s political gains.  His presence bleeds sexuality with his stance and handsome features, but his voice and actions will melt your heart first with a wanting desire.Dedicated to his cause for love of country and keeping the English from signing a treaty that will unite Scotland under their rule, he can only come up with one solution and puts the plan in motion to keep the treaty from happening and that is to capture the niece of the Duke of Queensberry.  However, what he doesn&#8217;t anticipate is falling head over heels in love with his charming captive Miss Amelia Bell.  No his adventure turns into not only a win for Scotland but a fight for an unconditional sacrifice for love than to ever live without her.Amelia has got to be my favorite character of all time.  I absolutely loved her.  I never laughed so hard &#8211; I literally had tears coming out of my eyes with her accident prone actions.  She reminded me of &#8220;KANE - the demon of Disaster&#8221; from the series Lords of the Underworld where every time she touched something or went somewhere disaster followed her in a humorous way.Amelia truly captured my heart with her tender innocent demeanor.  She is one of those females that is not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well.  Her loyalty and dedication to her family is unconditional but her love for true passion puts a few adventurous curves in her road to happiness especially when she meets her dreamy godlike &#8220;David of Goliath&#8221; Edmund.Tormented between having a life with a man of her dreams and with honoring her father&#8217;s wishes of an arranged marriage to Seafield - the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, a man she doesn&#8217;t love.  Amelia&#8217;s heart breaks knowing the sacrifice she must make in order to not ruin her father&#8217;s status among the English aristocrats.The story is full of adventure and lots of Highlander action making it a fast read.  The sweet and tender erotic romance had the perfect amount of teasing and playful love making scenes (3 Flames).  The happy ever after had me smiling and hugging the book with giddiness.I have to say that this is my first book by Paula Quinn and I am awed in amazement of how addictive her writing is.  The plot was perfect, the characters were brilliantly created, and the world building is one I could live in forever.  Paula Quinn you have gained a new fan and I look forward to reading more of your awesome work.  I highly recommend this read to all Historical Romance lovers.Excellent Read!', 'Light the Lamp is sweet, sexy and inspiring, it will have you smiling as brightly as Noelle&#8217;s cheery disposition and make you want to believe people so giving live among us as well as move you to try to be like them.Noelle has been down on her luck because she recently lost her job and then her house, but her viewpoint isn&#8217;t keeping luck company. She has a positive attitude knowing she&#8217;ll find a solution to her problems especially since worry has never rolled up its sleeves and solved anything. And now, by a fortuitous happenstance she can continue making a difference and spreading cheer after being saved from an encounter with certain death by a stranger.Liam &#8220;Kally&#8221; Kallen has been scarred by his wife&#8217;s death. Not only has his career suffered from it, he is also plagued with a guilt he can hardly talk about much less expunge, tinting his life a dull gray. That is until his concern leads him to save Noelle and his protectiveness guides him to incorporate her into his life. She gives him a new optimistic view and a second chance at love he thought he would never get again.The only problem is Liam and Noelle have too much to give. Liam in the way of material needs and Noelle in terms of positive emotions. Their relationship was too new, moving too fast it&#8217;s overwhelming, forcing Noelle to walk away unless they can find a way to balance their bond.I ached for Liam and his broken soul. Liam made me sympathized with him and his tragic loss. I felt terrible for his misplaced guilt, I understood his confusion over the new opportunity life gave him at a perfect love. He&#8217;s a different kind of take charge heroI enjoyed reading about.I was completely charmed with Noelle&#8217;s character and her desire to do something meaningful with her life. I honestly wish I had that strength of character. But there were also times when my very practical side wanted to slap her and Liam silly for not talking, exploring options and trying to find some kind of middle ground.It&#8217;s really great reading about the previous couples and characters in the team. Their family like bond and their support in this particular book shone through.I was so glad I got to read more about Jamie Babcock, having him living with Kally. He&#8217;s still young enough to be completely cute and adorable but also old enough to be an alpha male with his very own Babs signature.Liam and Noelle&#8217;s story blew me away with the amount of emotions it stirred. A couple of times bringing me to tears. It moved me and left me wanting to make a difference myself.This is the third book in the Portland Storm series. You could probably read it without reading the previous books but you would be missing out on the characters that appear as secondary in this book. I strongly suggest you read the series in order.And for those of you who are Tammy Falkner fans and follow her Reed Brothers series, can you guess where Liam gets his tattoos at?', \"Short but what a story.

The premise of the good 'vanilla' girl and the tattooed bad boy was old.I was left wondering what this book had to do with the Dumont brothers. Apart from being set in the same town I can only see one character from this novella that transfers over into the next book of the series.  Otherwise, I didn't get the connection.One can only hope that when we get to the Dumont brothers stories things will pick up because I love Macy's writing.\", 'While the zombie genre is rather absurdly overcrowded with knock-offs, I found this one to be pretty enjoyable. It felt a lot like a well-written novelization of a sci-fi zombie video game, which is to say that while its not terribly deep, it was a fun adventure that kept me reading.Overall, I found this book pretty enjoyable.', \"I've been meaning to read this reboot for a while. Despite all the mixed reactions people have had to the New 52, I've been hearing a lot of great things from people I trust about this new take on Wonder Woman. But I was still on the fence so I waited until my library got a copy of the trade. Now after reading I feel like an ass for waiting for so long, because it is awesome.Wonder Woman has always been a blending of mythology and the DC universe, but Azzarello takes it to the next level. While some mythology and DC purists might not like the changes, I loved them. On so many levels.First, the feel of this story has more of a mythological atmosphere. It reminds me a lot of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series. We're dropped into the story, with a narrative that sounds right out of folk tale and action befitting a flagship title for DC. Yeah, this is a Wonder Woman title, while many people view her as a diplomat and peace keeper, they forget that she is also an Amazonian princess, equal in strength and power to Superman. In this story Diana doesn't hesitate to kicks ass and takes name.The story is compelling, the art is stunning, but above all that, this is a Wonder Woman I can relate to, as well as admire. She is bold, conflicted, and rightfully so. The very foundation of her existence is shaken. Everything about how she viewed herself, and her mother changes in this story, and still Diana stays true to herself and her mission.This is a dark story, lots of bloodshed, death and raw humanity. Which is right up my alley. The supporting cast is great, and diverse in very surprising ways (I LOVE Chaing's take on all the goods, especially Apollo). Gods like Hermes, Apollo and Eris are deeply involved in the story, along with the very human character Zola, who plays a big part in the story. Zola is awesome, she delivers a lot of fantastic lines that made me laugh out loud, but is also very sympathetic. She didn't ask to be thrown into the middle of a godly power struggle, but she does a great job of coping with all it.I also love the look of Diana in this book. Yes, she still has the hour-glass figure of the classic Wonder Woman, but she is taller, and broader. She looks like an Amazon of legend. She also fights like a warrior, gets in the action. Chaing does a fantastic job with action shots, and her design. Giving us enough of the old to keep her familiar, but with a whole new take on everything from her costume, complexion and stature. Paired with Azzarello's fantastic storytelling, we get a great example of a what a reboot can do. This team does it right.I can't recommend this book enough. Even if you've never read comic books, if you like Wonder Woman, mythology, or just stories featuring kick ass women at the helm, you should give this one a try.\", \"Well written novel of a brother and sister who have been raised by unconventional parents and taught in a free school based on Rousseau's principles of education. The brother has some kind of disability but is only referred to as slow but the parents refuse to have him diagnosed by a doctor or evaluated by professionals. As an adult, the brother is accused of a crime and it appears his upbringing and free education didn't help him very well. I don't agree with many of the ideas of education here but the author portrays a really well thought out story of family dysfunction.\", 'Great new characters, good development, as always raises more questions then it answers.

I only found the action scenes somewhat unrealistic and the authors overuse of the word &#34;scream&#34; was a bit irritating.', 'I am a fan of Sally Wright, having read her whole Ben Reese series which is an excellent Detective series featuring an archivist. who had been a Second World War combat proven scout. So it was natural that I read her latest book. and was pleasantly surprised in the direction in which it took, a departure from pure crime to a more traditional novel. I am told that it is the first in a planed trilogy.It a novel with broad mature understanding that examines bonds people form: those between siblings, child to parents and vice-versa, to friends, comrades in arm, and even with four legged creatures. In this case the animals are primary horses. I know little about horses but my own dogs and cats provides me with a feel  how much a person can love and cherish an animal. However the size of horses adds an element of danger to the relationship as a horse can accidental or intentionally kill a person.The story centers around two families of the horse set, one that breeds and trains horses and the other who has a family business manufacturing transportation equipment for horses. There are a number of lesser characters that cluster around the families. The various threads of  relatioship quickly weave an interesting narrative filled with action and drama that should hold any readers attention. My hope is that Sally will be able to continue this trilogy.', \"Rocky Point SeriesBook 1This was a sweet book about Joe Kincaid who was widowed with a seven year old daughter and a brother who would rather race cars in Europe than stay in the small town.  It's also about newcomer, Gillian Parker, who just discovered she had a great grandmother who left her her estate.The story is fast paced and involves some mystery about someone who is causing &#34;accidents&#34; among the two main characters.  Gillian also helps Joe to loosen up on his parenting and give Jenny more space.  I really liked the characters in this book.  The mystery part is really pretty light and is resolved fairly simple, but sometimes that's good.  I do think the ending was a bit sudden...\", 'This chronicles are so interesting.

Many times a novella will leave me wanting more on some level.  More story, more character development, more of something.  Relic Of Death is perfect, just where it is.It's difficult to give a story synopsis without revealing too much.  As you can tell from the beautiful cover (Darfuse always has exceptional covers), it has something to do with a mystical suitcase.The story is told through a series of vignettes as the object changes hands violently over time.  Before it all becomes too repetitious, Bernstein reveals the truth about the Relic Of Death and gives the tale some closure, for now.This is my first time reading David Bernstein, it certainly won't be my last.  With clear, crisp prose, he delivers page after page just what the story calls for.  No fluff, no wasted words.Relic Of Death is another winning entry in the Darkfuse novella series.

At times it seemed like I kept reading pages, yet not much was going on.  The plot was convoluted and I found it all pretty uninteresting. I liked the main character, but in general found most of the characters flat.  It's not that the writing or anything about this book was bad, just not gripping or intriguing.  I will not be reading another Habit novel.\", 'If one were to be politically correct, that is, ideologically sound, one would characterize the debate between Darwinism and intelligent design as between science and the Bible, between reason and superstition.  That is how it is essentially portrayed in the media and the scientific establishment.Author Jonathan Wells, however, is anything but politically correct.  He portrays the debate as a conflict between two views of what is real.  On the one side are the Darwinists, protectors of a materialist creation myth which begins with the words \"in the beginning were the particles in mindless motion.\"  And on the other side are proponents of intelligent design, most of whom would affirm John chapter one, \"in the beginning was the Word.\"Not all I.D. proponents are Christians, but all are open to the possibility that nature may show the hallmarks not only of natural causes but also of intelligent causes.  This is decidedly a politically incorrect point of view, and with examples Wells illustrates the professional cost one may incur for holding it.By citing philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, he shows why the current Darwinian power structure is digging in its heels and refusing to consider evidence that does not comport with its materialist paradigm.  But if Kuhn is right, Wells has reason to be confident that even now we are seeing the beginning of a paradigm shift as the last and strongest bastion of nineteenth-century materialism - Darwinism, crumbles before the growing onslaught of the evidence.  Darwinism may go down kicking and screaming, but it will go down.', \"All these twists, turns and discoveries. There were things I was shocked to understand that tied all the way back to the Growing Pains trilogy. The way Vic and Lyric are forced to potentially look at each other now... the truth about Blood's behavior... I'm still kinda shocked that Tricey has gotten away with all she's done despite throwing Blood's dirt in her face.Jessica writes some amazing stuff.

Eisler tends to have a lot of atmospheric description and is tight with details on training, weapons, violence, and what Rain is thinking. It was hard to get a sense of the streets ape of Manila. It was almost insulting to read the line (paraphrasing here), &#34;I checked to make sure I had weapons...and all that.&#34; Pretty far removed from John Rain. No details on the plan, type of knife, exploring the angles and options for implementing his plan. The fight sequences with the Russians read like a bad movie plot. Trading face punches? No judo or grips and holds? Joking with new partners like they are life long friends?If you've read any real Rain stories, then you know this doesn't fit.\", \"It's been a long time since a book has literally swept me off me feet.

I will say if you liked Fifty, you will probably like this series as well , but it's not fair to the author to say that it's &#34;just like&#34; that other,I certainly didn't think so! Better to come into this series with an open mind and just let it happen.Of course, Hudson is a rich, demanding a$$ who doesn't believe in love. Of course, Alayna is a smart, beautiful woman with issues of her own. This is a romance novel, and the majority of romance novels I have read are based on this premise, it is the skill of the author that makes each story special and engaging, and why I keep reading them.

The story is about a family in a small southern town called Heaven, Louisiana.The heroine is Schyler Crandall who has returned home to Heaven from London, where she escaped to after her sister, Tricia betrays her.  Schyler has come back to the family home named Belle Terre, an old southern home that she loves, because her father has had a major heart attack.  Since her father is in the hospital, Schyler takes on the family business.The book is heavy on very crass language and sex scenes.  If you are looking for a romance novel, then this book is hot what I would call romantic, The romantic involvement for Schyler is a Cajun who lives on the bayou, Cash Boudreaux.  He is as foul mouthed and crude as they come.  How any woman could find anything romantic about this man is beyound me.There are a number of other sex scenes with other characters that I basically skipped over.  I am not a blushing virgin and I have read many romance novels in the past but this one is so crass that I was even appalled.Also for dog lovers, this book has a pit bull fight that I could not read.  Cruelty to animals and to people is another reason that I did not like this book.  Also stereotypes abound about the south in this book that are so overdone as to be silly.&#34;Slow Heat in Heaven&#34; is one of Sandra Brown's earlier novels; I will stick to reading her more current books because they have more appeal to me.

Here he presents a very good Loki story that delves into his personality and focuses on more than his jealousy of Thor.  I'm glad he didn't try to make him seem like a misunderstood hero but an actual villain with interesting motivations.  Seeing Marvel's Norse history, no matter how many times its retold, is always a treat.  The art by Sebastian Fiumara was very good, although slighty rushed at times.  The darker elements of the story looked appropriately grittier than more joyous scenes.  Overall, a very very good Loki tale.\", \"&#34;Shadow Catcher: A Novel (Nick Baron Series)&#34; by James R.

It was well written I just think that the hero didn't act much like one in the beginning.  Griffon does grow on you as time goes on and I began to like Jade more too as the story progressed. As I got to the end of the book I realized what bothered me so much was the element of humiliation in it.  I love books with spanking and different kinds if discipline but humiliation is a turn off.  Too, there is a secondary story that has Griffon spanking Tasha and other employees. I prefer my stories to have a one man one woman spanking relationship.

When one of the two suspects is quickly found murdered, the Leggetts' story about what really happened begins to unravel. As it does, the past and the present slowly reveal themselves in a quagmire of trouble.For most novels, this would be enough material to fill one book, but for Dashiell Hammett, this is only the first of three parts that become steadily darker and seedier as the story progresses. The key figure in the book is Gabrielle Leggett, the confused, aloof daughter plagued by her own demons. Just when the Continental Op thinks he's done with the family, he's asked to watch over Gabrielle who's recovering from tragedy at a Temple, which appears to be a religious cult. From there, things only get worse.What can I say about Dashiell Hammett that hasn't already been said? Having read his work after so many years, I understand why he's considered one of the masters of the detective novel. It was a welcome change to read mystery that's kicking it old style. There's no hi-tech gimmicks in this story, just a lot of leg work and--on the downside--some sexism and racist slurs that were prevalent back then. Still, this whodunit will keep you guessing as hidden agendas and connections make a simple plot increasingly complex. Having said that, the twisted motivations and secret relationships in this book became so extensive that it stretched credibility by the end, however this won't deter us true Hammett fans from reading more of his work.\", 'I thoroughly enjoyed this book and all of the characters in the storyline, especially the hero and heroine of this book.

I recommend this book for anyone that enjoys a steamy read full of suspense, and even a bit of action. It\\'s intensely addictive and Definitely a page turner! I love Felicia Fox\\'s work,I can\\'t wait to start on Crave and read anything else this author writes in the future.', \"Shirley Jones is a lovely woman who in some ways had a charmed career, working with the likes of Cagney, Lancaster and Brando, starring in some films that have withstood the test of time, pulling off a coup a la Donna Reed with an Oscar-winning against-the-grain turn, and cementing her fame with an iconic TV show at just the right moment.  She's a pro.  This autobiography is revealing as she shows her ribald side, and addresses her fatal attraction to her famous husband Jack Cassidy and her unlikely but successful  marriage to Marty Engels.When you think Shirley Jones, you think pretty, pleasant, warm, calm, talented.  She wants to add another dimension to that image, and makes some odd choices in what she writes about, the most talked-about being her obsession with sex, and that mars the book.  Is it autobiography or confessional or how-to- manual or what?But it's her book, her way, and that's what you get.\", \"Originally published at Rookie Romance.The blurb got me very excited, a wallflower and a criminal looking for redemption? Um, yes please!Audrey is a wallflower, but wants so much more from her life than what her parents have planned for her. She longs for adventure and an escape. She certainly dives head first into adventure when Ethan Jagger/Locke shows up injured at her window. I liked Audrey, she has guts and I admired her determination to enjoy her life and escape the box her parents were trying to put her in. But I found her actions rather puzzling in the first third of the book. I'm not sure how much she knew Ethan previously, but her grandfather was just assaulted by some ruffians and she up and leaves with a man she barely knows who is clearly running from someone. Then when she realises that Ethan is running from Bow Street, she continues on her 'adventure' with him. It just came across as kind of reckless and foolish, to be honest. Fair enough, I understood her motivations, but I read it with a raised eyebrow. Once Ethan and Audrey's relationship develops, the eyebrow lowered and it made sense that she stuck by him and defended him.Ethan has a criminal past that he's trying to put behind him. He wants nothing more than to let go of the past and mend his relationship with his brother, unfortunately that past does not want to let go of him. When he's falsely accused of murdering a Marquess, he's forced to literally run for his life. Ethan likes Audrey, but he never intended to bring her with him. As they spend more time together though,he realises that she's an unusual young lady and there's a lot more to her than meets the eye. Ethan has done a lot in his past that he regrets and he wants to become a better man, the man his father intended for him to be.I enjoyed Ethan and Audrey's relationship. I thought her optimism and innocence balanced his cynicism and made him a bit less jaded. Ethan is a good man at heart, and Audrey sees that man.I could get a little lost with all the characters, at times. It's part of a series and can be read as a stand alone, but there are a lot of characters who are clearly in the previous books in the series and it could be difficult to remember who was who. Although, it doesn't affect the reading of this book particularly.Overall, I liked it but I didn't love it. The characters held a lot of promise but fell a bit flat for me. I was left feeling luke warm about this, although I'm interested to read some of the other character's stories in previous books of the series.*I received a review copy form the publisher, via NetGalley, for my honest opinion. Thank you!\", 'Wonderful book.  Love all of nicholas sparks books. He is a great author plus a lot of his books take place in Wilmington, NC & my sister lives there. Lovely little town!', 'All the number books are good. Some better think than others. I think the first 4 or 5 are the best.', 'Yeah a happy ending! Lovely written and very funny. Victor and Sarah are just so perfect together! Read this book!', \"Such an emotional book. I have been waiting for this book since I finished with the first one and it did not disappoint. I love Nova and Quinton. And can't wAit till the next one comes out.\", \"I enjoyed this book even though the subject matter deals with one of the most terrifying events or series of events in the history of  the modern world:  The systematic murder of millions of Jewish men, women and children by one of the world's most notorious  psychopaths:  Adolph Hitler.  The story is told primarily through the eyes of a young Jewish man, Jacob Weisz, Weisz is arrested and transported to Auschwitz for his part in freeing 200 Jews who are being transported by train to Auschwitz for eventual extermination.  While Weisz is a fictional character, this chronicle of his ordeal and eventual escape from that notorious death camp is very real.  I cannot begin to image what innocent people went through at this place of true horror but this novel does create a believable picture of one man's existence there.\", 'This is a light hearted story about, a nice unsophisticated no none sense woman who agrees to help her boss, convince his long lost sister that he is engaged and quite happy. This is for one week end but she falls for instead. He also becomes very smitten. And the race is on. Avery read that ends before you realize it . A good read but short but worth your time.', \"Book was Amazing!  Very tender and heartfelt for a man to show that kind of love for a woman he held so dear.Was very emotion and she describes  the scenery so well and in such detail you feel  as though you are right there with the characters.  Loved this book now I'm going to get the whole series of the McKaslin'sI would recommend this to everyone!\", \"I'm two-thirds done with this memoir, and I find that it lacks emotion. Lawyers and judges need to be emotionally unattached to their cases, and this book definitely reads like it was written by a lawyer. I find myself asking &#34;how did she feel?&#34; during many of the pages. She talks nothing about her feelings for her boyfriend/husband. Was he her first love? He would visit her every weekend during college -- how did she feel about the long-distance relationship? Did she have any doubts? As for her accomplishments, I still find myself wondering how she felt about herself. I'm sure this book is inspiring to many people, but I was hoping to learn more about the woman behind the robe, not the making of a judge. I'll finish the book because my book club is reading it, but I'm disappointed.\", \"Tracie Banister's wickedly delicious chick-lit novel offers readers a superb behind-the-scenes-look into the lives of five high profile actresses vying to be the winner of this year's Oscar in the Best Actress category.

While this book was fictional, it's very sad to know that this kind of thing is actually happening right under our noses to our children in the United States of America.  My heart breaks for these young girls who have their childhoods stripped away.  That made it hard to read the book, but at the same time, I had to know how the story ended for Brianna and her family.  The book is well written and informative at the same time.\", \"Can't add much to all of the positive reviews above. It's really that good, a thoroughly enjoyable read, and you don't necessarily have to be a fan of pulp fiction to appreciate it.Otherwise, I've been a fan of Saunders' books since I first read his sword & sorcery (or more correctly sword & soul) adventure Imaro way back in the early 1980s. I hope there are more Damballa novels in the pipeline...\", \"Nice photos and simple text though it's difficult to determine what age group is being targeted.  The text is too advanced for young children and to simple for older ones.\", 'I enjoyed the book.  It was a little different from what I have been reading.  It kept my interest and I will definitely check out other things he has written.', 'Book is well written and enjoyable to read. It was a fairly quick read too. The characters are Interesting too. BUT, the Keanu Reeves movie is nothing like it.  The movie is good in its own rights but there should be almost no comparison between the two.  Its simply historical fact versus Hollywood schlock!', \"Brief synopsis: Karissa is a young college student with a fun, rich and quirky roommate.  Karissa has no money and her only family is her mom.  Her mother is paranoid and Karissa believes she is somewhat mentally unstable.  She is also a recluse. Karissa meets our hero Naz when he is in her classroom speaking to one of her professors.  Shaking him down actually but Karissa does not know this. And that is how they meet. Naz isn't just some handsome stranger.  He is a very dangerous man. And he wants Karissa. This book ends in a cliffhanger that was so delicious!I devoured every word of this book.  I loved Naz so much and I was a little afraid of him too.  I especially loved how the author did not do the insta love connection.  Naz's possessiveness comes to a slow boil and you are just like the lobster...you don't know its to late until...well its to late.  Karissa is a bit immature and a bit trusting but it is believable for her age and situation.  I mean what young girl on her own wouldn't want to be around a dark and sexy man.  And he is dark.  And dangerous.  And sexy.  But the author does a great job of allowing the reader to learn these things along with Karissa.  We are not told what a bad ass he is.  We are not told how violent and deadly.  But we learn and we realize like someone in her shoes. Karissa had realistic and believable reactions to everything Naz did.  And Naz...oh man...you do not walk away from this man.  I am praying that the author keeps up his alpha domineering ways in the next book. I want the dark. I want the scary and shocking.\", \"I am a long time Mary Balogh fan, and this is the best one she has written in a while.  I bought the kindle version and I was about to buy the short story The Suitor as well.  I'm glad I didn't because the kindle version of this book includes that short story for free at the end.  It was also good, and interesting as it tied in with the last book I read before this one, The Arrangement.\", \"This book is third of 3part series. I recommend u read them in order as they continue the storyline throughout all 3books. It had good parts and lulls in the story. Overall it was ok but not my favorite. I found some of the characters incredibly self centered and thoughtless toward others  (don't want to give story away) but very &#34;different&#34; kind of plots.\", \"Like all of Andre Norton's books, a wonderful fantasy world to get lost in, totally enjoyable and exciting and worth the read.\", \"Really enjoyed this instalment of the series! Finally Honor and Grayson get together, we've all been waiting for this since Brutes book! I feel bad for what happened to her in London so I cheered when she finally let go her rage and went for Angus' throat in the story! It was a long journey for her to get to that stage, she'd had a lot of healing to do but when she let go of her fear and attacked him I couldn't help the smile on my face!I loved how patient Grayson was with her throughout the book, helping her heal. I also loved that we seen another side of Alex and Maya when they were dealing with Honor at the start but my favourite thing about Ridgeville was how they all came together to help Honor in any way they could. The chemistry between Grayson and Honor was amazing and they certainly built the sexual tension between them until Honor was ready to mate with Grayson. She had some demons to face before she could be in the right headspace to mate with Grayson without freaking out!I hope there are more Ridgeville books as there are a few characters we didn't see (two we heard mentioned, one who appeared and a new character I'd like more off) that I'd like to see get their HEA, like the Mastin sisters and Stone as well as Deuce's sister too.\", \"I had read good things about this series, and was hoping it would be as good as the All Souls Trilogy by Debra Harkness. But not even close. I don't plan to read the 2nd book in the series.The main characters are a mom and her two daughters- Joanna, Ingrid and Freya. They live in mythical North Hampton LI, near Gardiners Island. They have been forbidden to use their powers since the Salem Witch trials, but they find themselves tempted when things in their town start getting strange. Freya is struggling to decide between two men, librarian Ingrid is too staid, and Joanna just wants to mother the housekeeper's son. I found the characters interesting, but the plot line got a bit random and overdone (for me) with the mythology, underworld, vampire and zombie popping up. I would have liked this better with just the lighthearted white magic (like the Accidental Witch series).\", 'Author had me in the first few pages, it initially reminded me of The Hunger Games, which I loved.Wonderfully descriptive characters and scenes make you feel like you are in the story and participating right along side of these two would be Hunters.  This tale keeps you on the edge of your seat with lots of action and with a smattering of mystery and intrigue thrown in for good measure.I Loved It!  I would highly recommend this book to all readers.Keep up the great work, Kaye!  You knocked it outa the ballpark with this one, please give us more.', \"This was a easy read. The story line was good. It had sadness in it that you really felt by way the author wrote. This book really showed how there truly can be kind people out there and that you really can't always go by what you hear.  I enjoyed this story and would recommend to anyone looking for a heart touching story.\", \"This story is a quick read that quickly gets to a struggle between two people who have not been in the best of situations but take the time to work together and find out whats important. Why this book is short and sweet its a fun read.

I enjoy romance and sensuous scenes - which are emotional. This is very graphic, so the skipped pages, because of the distasteful extraneous descriptions -- of body parts in activity-- would make me skip buying her again unless many pages of story were not very inexpensive. Also, the people are not the kind I would like as friends, because it is their character I object to. I would pay for half the reading, for half the cost - on sale. Otherwise, there are other good authors around that I do not skip their word-craft, though Sharon is good at that, if she would be more mature in her tastes.', 'Interesting characters and back storylines. Horrible childhood filled a teen into adulthood and servitude. Romance blooms under definitely strained circumstances.', '&#34;Daily Rituals&#34; is an important book in my collection.

First off, just so you are aware Fall (Cold Mark #1) is a serial novel.  In my excitement to read another book by my new favorite author, I didn't see how short this novella is...  However, don't let that stop you from diving into this amazing new series.This is a (very) adult sci-fi romance that is exceptionally original.  The main character Braita is brave young woman thrust into a terrifying new world.  Everything she's ever known is now different.  This first novella gets you through the beginnings of how she ends up on the foreign world of Mian, and how she begins living with Malik and Leo.  You'll be amazed at the journey you go through in just 8 short chapters, and I guarantee you'll be left wanting more.  I absolutely can't wait for the next novella in this series.\", 'While I found some of the examples interesting, this book read a bit like listening to a motivational seminar.

The story was alright, but I was glad when I finally finished.\", \"If you read the first book I don't think the second book will disappoint. Sakavic has captured the language of youth making it all the more real. A word of caution. You do have to place close attention to the background character explanations to get various relationships. This enables you to follow certain sequences. Admittedly, the author could have a bit more clarity in this area. Eventually, though, you figure it out.The problem I have with a series is when you have to wait for the final installment. It's rather a let down. But, I did read the conclusive segment should occur sometime January, 2014. I can hope. I have one issue with the second book that did follow a conventional mind set that bugs me.  Nicky(Neil's teammate and openly gay character) rants to Neil about the only way Neil will have a happy life is having a significant other.  Otherwise, this dooms Neil to a joyless life. I've commented on this issue previously in other critiques. Are you telling me that even thought I have decent caring friends, a purposeful life, a loving relationship with myself open toward the other  that if I 'don't have someone' I'm doomed to a miserable life.? Listen up. There are people who lead a happy existence with caring attachments and are ok. Don't get me wrong. It is desirable to have a partner but not a need to prevent a fulfilling life. I'll stop now.Ah, don't let me distract from the fact that I still consider the second book highly recommendable.\", \"If you plan on making your own baby food, I HIGHLY recommend this book.

Unfortunately for the two of them, Logan is not the only obstacle to their happy ever after.  The reader will be completely surprised at which character(s) pose a deadly threat to Savannah and Kayden&#8217;s happiness.Although I don&#8217;t condone violence, I have to say that I love it that Savannah punched Logan.  While we have to constrain ourselves in the real world it was amazing to see a cheating guy get what he deserves on the written page.  Although I didn&#8217;t think it possible, this sequel may have even surpassed the original in every way.  The sex is even hotter, the drama is even more intense, and the cliffhanger will leave your jaw on the floor.  Danielle Jamie is a superb writer.', \"I don't like books about violence and bad things happening to good people, particularly about the Nazi's and their victims.The only thing i knew about Leningrad and the WWII battle of was that it was very cold and snows a lot and often.The two main characters (particularly the narrator) however grabbed me immediately and I wound up wanting to stop reading because of some of the ugliness but could not.Here were two good young men both able to see the humor in life coping with awful circumstances.I do recommend it to people who are up for a an adventure and are not too weak-hearted about the inhumanity of man.\", \"I liked this book more than the first one. I really enjoyed the premise of arranged marriage and the two warring countries trying to establish peace and unity. I liked the different customs of the two countries and how both Gabrielle and Alec had to overcome their dislike for each other. I liked their relationship and the way things turned out in the end.The things I didn't like were pretty much the same as the first book. I felt like an observer of the story, as the characters go about their lives without much detail. While it had a nice, sweet feel to it, I felt like I was constantly being told, rather than shown, the characters' emotions.That being said, the book is very clean, enjoyable, and quick to read. It is suitable for teen and adult readers.Content: Clean\", 'While the illustrations are great and the course is well presented.

And lots of sexcapades that included all. So no- no real plot but you will learn quite a bit reading this one!', \"This story grew tired quickly.  I was over Annie about three chapters in.  It grates my patience to read about a beautiful smart heroine who is strong in all her decision making except when it comes to trusting her emotions.  She goes for what she wants but not romantic happiness.  The author could have been erotic and sensual without the brazen profanity.  I think it negated the sexiness of the scenes.  Anyway, I will read the next book in the series because I want to know Antoinette's story.\", \"Eyes Wide Open is an engrossing mystery novel you can't put down. All the elements for a great read are present, believable characters, logical plot development, background with an integrated timeline, plausible story, the right amount of tension, and except for an unwanted open ending added to perhaps provide a segue to a sequel, the novel is perfect. Andrew Gross has developed a style such that I always expect the very best and in Eyes Wide Open: A Novel, he did not disappoint.\", 'I love this book and all the books so far in this series.

I am a second generation American who enjoyed reading Lullaby for all the touches of authenticity the author has included. She knows what she's writing about, and the cursing and f-bombs people are complaining about here did not bother me. It's not a nice little fairy tale, it's a modern novel about being young, female and Polish or Polish-American or both. it's not always pretty, but love and friendship hold life together, if you're smart enough to know it.I'd like to read another novel by this author.\", 'I\\'ve always been a believer but this was incredible and so many things that have recently happened to me.

I highly recommend it to all who know the importance of prayer.', \"First of all - though this might not sound like a endorsement, because I know some folks haven't dug Koontz's recent work as much - if you enjoy humor and wit in your dark fantasy/horror/supernatural thrillers, especially the easy wit in some of Koontz's sharper works, and if you enjoy Odd Thomas, this is the book for you. Luna is witty, tough, proudly dysfunctional in a gleeful sort of way, yet honestly broken, too. And though she's got a lot of Buffy Somers in her - she's not the &#34;Chosen One&#34; with super powers or super strength or resiliency. She knows the demonic because it's haunted her since childhood. She can see demons, she can fight them,  but the only thing she's got up on regular human beings is her knowledge and association with demons, and that's it.The story's pacing is smooth, with easily-consumed, concise chapters, and the story moves right along. Yardley is very confident in telling this story, and making this world seem real.  Also, we get the sense that the supernatural world we're exposed to here is merely a fraction of what's to come, so if you like supernatural mythos/mash-ups like The Dresden Files or Supernatural, this might be a good fit for you, also.Finally, I do want to address the issue of some tense slippage, which I saw someone mention in another review (that ironically misused grammar in its title). There is a little tense slippage, between first person present and first person past. But experienced readers will realize these are merely blips that got overlooked in the editing process, and they in no way detract from the story at all. Even big NY publishers miss small things like. A proofing issue is not indicative of poor writing.Pick this up today, and join Luna on The Demon Patrol.

I have reviewed multiple books by this author and have liked every one.This book spans over 14 years. Lola is a young head strong math geek who believes that she is meant to change the world. She is giving it her best shot, but along the way she finds herself in a bit of trouble. And somehow she always manages to be wearing the wrong underwear every time it happens&#8230;Wearing a red lace thong while getting arrested isn't really the best option. She meets and falls for a sexy Australian named Wayne but she doesn't feel like he's the boy she should love. But over the course of the 14 years they somehow keep winding up finding each other again, even while she fights it all the way. Lola doesn't really know what she wants for the future or how to get it, but along the way she finds that maybe the wrong guy could end up being the right one after all.The name alone should have you intrigued. It did me. It's a cute and funny title to go with a cute and funny book. It hooks you and you can't wait to see how it all ends up. It wasn't really what I expected. I don't think the description does this book justice. I was expecting a light hearted romantic comedy and got so much more. While the book is cute and funny it is also real and has some serious moments.Lola is a great character. She is witty and funny and she makes these hilarious random lists. She is real and flawed beyond belief but you can't help but laugh and cry and prey that she can get it together. And maybe even find her happy ending.There is a bunch of humorous surrounding characters that make you laugh and really feel for all Lola has to put up with. With a bossy, slightly self obsessed; over involved mom and a sister very similar to their mom it makes for a laugh fest. And that is just the beginning of her crazy family and friends.  Wayne is a total boy crush and I kept begging for him to finally get the girl. He is rugged and sexy and oo la la. I wish there had been more of him in the story though, he was that good.It jumps around a bit throughout the 14 years to explain everything, but it's worth it. I was hooked quickly and couldn't put it down. I recommend this book completely.\", 'As with all the books in this series it was a lot of fun, there was drama,action,comedy, every thing you need in a good book.', 'but again its is always too short!!If you havent read the Samantha Moon series, you really should!Well Written, entertaining, total laugh out loud moments, with believable characters and concrete story lines, they will quickly become your favorite too.J.R Rain, thank you for being a Author.(I like to believe that he owns a pomeranian, which of course are THE best dogs to have)', \"He begins with a brilliant point, the fact that life is navigated by choices you've made between what actually happen and how you 'choose' to response to it and you can improve and make that gap seems longer by what he teach.Follow by another brilliant point that most organizations still haven't unleashed the potential of human by using carrot-and-stick, not the whole person model, which people will be driven by the deeper purposes.There are also many good points from lifetime experience of man who has been through a lot, meeting and teaching many people and organizations. He seems to anticipate most of the responses audience have with his teaching. I wish I could one day join some of his workshops.But at times, he tries to connect the dot that doesn't seem to exist. Most of the points he made are brilliant, but the way he consolidate it into the model is not.At times, he tries to force the idea to fit into the fact and introduce some diagrams that doesn't make sense.At times, he tries to make it more philosophical than necessary.These weak links reduce his credibility as I go through the pages.Together, it seems he aim at the 'theory of everything' about leadership, which I think he did well in covering all important points. It is good and useful if you screen out some ideas that doesn't make sense, and be not too rigid in application of what he teach in real life.\", 'I like Michael Connelly very much. The writing is good and the character is very human. I would buy another of his books.', \"Unfortunately, Fix You was not for me. I have been known to enjoy the serial books that are becoming a &#34;thing&#34; but, I think this book would have been better off sitting a little bit longer and coming out as a full story and not pieced out. I feel that the serials are meant for very emotional, and raw stories. Fix You didn't accomplish that with me. It felt disjointed and very rushed. I could not bring myself to like the heroine, Olivia, she seemed childish, and naive. Whereas, Bash has so much riding on his job, and seemed to be a stand up guy for his family until Olivia makes him lose his head. It just didn't click with me. The story, the characters, their circumstances and their chemistry. Something just seemed off.That being said, Fix You does have the potential to grow into a book I would like to read. It did end on a mild cliffhanger which will probably intrigue me enough to move on to the second book. But the second serial is going to have to possess major growth where Olivia is concerned, and more explanation where her family is concerned, and build more on Bash and Olivia's relationship. The way part one ended, it just felt like a physical connection with no deeper meaning between the two.Again, I don't mind serials but they have to be done fantastically. This one was just so-so, and the fact that it was a serial on top of that just made it more frustrating than anything. I want to be left needing and wanting more. Fix You just left me perplexed and wanting it to have gone the extra mile and reach its potential. I sincerely hope this was just a slow start and then next parts in the book will rise to the occasion.Happy Reading!*ARC provided by the author/publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*\", \"I loved every moment!

I just thought that whole scene with her screaming at the zombies and then being able to walk away unmolested was more pivotal than it apparently was.

Dom Matt involves his sub Adam in the plans for how to train Parker to come on command without any penetration or touch to his cock.The strategy they come up with involves strict discipline and the use of toys. When Gaston and Parker agree to the lessons they ask for demonstrations, so the reader gets two views of the same scene, once with the experienced couple and again with the trainees.Gaston has to convince Parker that if they do not achieve their goal they must put this behind them and move on. Parker, on the other hand, feels he should leave Gaston so he can find a sub who can follow any command Gaston cares to give. Either way, it&#8217;s up to Gaston to make Parker feel successful.This is a very, very sexy story. It comes close to porn without plot but doesn&#8217;t take that one extra step off the cliff, remaining grounded in the story of BDSM training.

At the end of Working It I was DYING, I needed to know if my Ben and Emmy were going to make it. Could they work through their issues? Could they accept the paternity results of Fiona&#8217;s pregnancy? These were the questions I needed answers to&#8230;desperately! And thank goodness all of my questions were answered but not without a few bumps along the way. Kendall upped the angst here which I loved and she also upped Ben&#8217;s sweet romantic side which had me swooning with a capital S. I&#8217;m telling you, he went over and above to not only tell Emmy how he felt about her, he showed her as well. I loved him! I also liked seeing how Emmy lost a bit of her naivet&eacute;, she was still our sweet caring girl, BUT she no longer let Fiona push her around. She stood her ground when it came to her and her underhanded comments & usual Fiona nastiness. She put her in her place. If I could, I&#8217;d high five Emmy.All in all I think Craving Him was a sweet, sexy (this is Kendall after all, she&#8217;s a master of sexy) conclusion for Ben & Emmy and I can&#8217;t wait for All or Nothing, Ellie and Braydon&#8217;s story, due out in September &#60;3', \"This story hooked me from the beginning and the further I got the more I couldn't put it down.

I didn't like the big age gap between herself and the two male characters.I also would have liked more interaction between the ordinary Regency world and the magic world; maybe see more manipulation of the ordinary world by the magi.All in all an enjoyable read and I look forward to the rest of the series.\", \"Drew Evans has a spectacular personality but this is told from Kate's POV.

Will is Hannah&#8217;s brother&#8217;s best friend from childhood. They haven&#8217;t seen each other in years, but Hannah decides to catch up with Will again for old time sake. Hannah is no longer the young, little sister Will is use to seeing and when Hannah asks Will for sex advice, he can&#8217;t deny her.I liked Will in Beautiful Stranger and he is even better in Beautiful Player. I also like how nerdy Hannah is. They become friends and bond over jogging in the mornings. It&#8217;s really cute seeing Will train Hannah and help her with her love life. Hannah isn&#8217;t a virgin, but she is differently not experienced. Chole and Sara from Beautiful Bastard and Beautiful Stranger, give Hannah a little make-over to get her up to par with the dating world.Hannah goes on a few dates and Will coaches her on how to act and what is appropriate and not appropriate behavior. Hannah has no filter and is really easy going with Will. I love this! She asks him random things, like if girls really do make the sounds she hears from watching porn. It&#8217;s just too funny and too cute!Yes, Will is a crazy player, he has two hook-buddies, he meets weekly. Who does that?! BUT he&#8217; also a really sweet guy and great friend. It&#8217;s very rare to see a sweet friendship form out of thin air. Yes, Hannah and Will have a history, but I really enjoyed reading the little moments they share and seeing their fast friendship form.I really enjoyed reading Beautiful Player and it was nice to see the old gang too. We see some progression with Chole, Bennett and Sarah and Max, which is always nice.

Casted starts out at a smooth pace then builds momentum up to the end when you are left with a cliffhanger that has you fumbling around to get started on Spelled.  Adventure, with a little romance mixed in. Nothing to make you blush but just enough that you get the idea. Great start to what looks to be a great series.', \"I think the authors had a very clear plan in mind. They probably got together and said something like: &#34;Hey, let's write a business novel about Theory of Constraints applied to IT Ops&#34; - that sums up what they were trying to achieve.If you have some knowledge about IT Ops, business novels and TCO, this books sounds as straightforward and predictable as a rail. So it's not the greatest fiction (the plot is fairy tale simple, the characters are over simplified), not the greatest IT Ops case study (while the technical language is perfectly real, the idea of, let's say, offloading &#34;brute force&#34; processing to an external cloud provider or reducing the release cycle within days or fighting off the auditors - all those examples look turning the company around seem hard to believe) and not the greatest book on TCO (for example the book doesn't tell about TCO limitations and side effects stressing out only the positives).However, having said all of that, the book creates an instantly recognized mix of a typical IT Ops management problems and it touches the nerve of hundreds of thousands people in IT Ops or working closely with IT Ops, so it gotta become a big hit.  It gives a very accurate snapshot of what problems IT Ops are facing now and what the mainstream approaches to solve those problems are at them moment. So definitely worth reading if you want to get familiar with the current state of IT Ops.\", 'What kind of medical system tells you that you\\'re doomed to a life of pain and suffering? To me, it\\'s shocking that almost no mainstream doctors and so few \"experts\", much less writers of books like this, are aware that fibromyalgia is a symptom of low thyroid (hypothyroid). Shocking.There are no lab tests for many causes of low thyroid, so at least 80% of us are mis-diagnosed, because your doctor will only treat lab tests, not you. The FREE basal (at rest) temperature self-test is THE gold standard for low thyroid problems and - with your symptoms - means more than any lab test (although most conventional doctors, including endos, won\\'t agree but then they\\'re not trained to understand thyroid problems - go to the Broda Barnes foundation website and click on the \"Educational Info\" button on the left for how to get a list of thyroid-sympathetic doctors in your state.(I\\'d always suspected a thyroid problem but it was not until, after 20 years of being told all my lab tests were \"normal\", that a Broda Barnes trained doctor finally put me on the road to recovery. A year after I insisted my cousin also see this doctor, she said I\\'d saved her life.)The basal temperature home self-test will pick up conditions that current lab tests don\\'t, such as thyroid resistance. Most digital thermometers are not accurate so find a good basal digital thermometer, the kind used by women to identify their fertile days.The stopthethyroidmadness website has excellent instructions for this self-test, as well as several for adrenal fatigue, which often goes hand-in-hand with low thyroid. The two most common health problems worldwide, they\\'re rarely diagnosed or treated.I also suggest:- \"The Metabolic Treatment of Fibromyalgia\" by Lowe, a very expensive medical book of more than 1,000 pages, essentially explaining how fibromyalgia is successfully treated with thyroid supplements;- `Hypothyroidism Type 2\\' by Mark Starr (\"type 2\" meaning the thyroid problems for which there are no lab tests and therefore they don\\'t get diagnosed) explains how all chronic pain is linked to low thyroid, including those involved with fibromyalgia, diabetes, heart problems, both bleeding & blood clots (including strokes) and some cancers. If you have any kind of chronic pain, you need to know that some are calling low thyroid the silent epidemic (silent because officially denied);- \"Hypothyroidism, Health & Happiness: The Riddle of Illness Revealed\" by Steven F. Hotze a good introduction;- As there is rarely more than a brief mention of the benefits of iodine in thyroid books, I also suggest \"Iodine, Why You Need It and Why You Can\\'t Live Without It\" by David Brownstein MD. The latest edition is available as an ebook from drbrownstein[dot]directfrompublisher[dot]comAlso, those with fibromyalgia experience a significant reduction in their symptoms when taking a melatonin supplement and melatonin can reduce some symptoms of IBS, such as abdominal pain. Melatonin increases the conversion of precursor thyroid hormone T4 to the active T3 form. It can reactivate the important but much-ignored thymus gland, which degenerates almost completely over the years. It also improves zinc absorption, which in turn boosts several immune functions. Melatonin therapy also helps spleen recovery, another immune-system component which declines with age. Its ability to improve sleep and dreaming is a tremendous boon to memory. It is one of the most powerful antioxidants made by the body.', 'I love Greek Mythology and this is a really great way to help get younger people interested in it. I loved this book and the sequels are brilliant. The characters are likable, there are a few unexpected twists and a nice romance story.

As these two are struggling and trying to find their place, they are also struggling with feelings that are arising between them.I loved this story as it shared the love that grows between Vince and Tina, but also continues the story for Jonas and the others.

The solution, as expected, is agape - the unconditional love, but only in the context of a deep understanding of the love of God, and our ultimate dependence on Him.

I also read the beginning, how the author was a busy mom who worked a night shift, trained Crossfit, and cooked for her family of four so I thought there would be a lot of easy practical recipes.I was disappointed to find that most of the recipes had a lot of ingredients, something the author complained about in other books. Many of the ingredients in recipes were also other recipes from the book, so for instance a chicken recipe may have 12 ingredients, one of which is bacon aioli which is 8 ingredients and another is cauliflower rice which is time consuming as well.I also wasn't crazy about the type of recipes. I'm looking for practical everyday meals, and I keep finding paleo books that try to recreate gourmet restaurant quality meals. The author is an admitted &#34;foodie&#34; and it shows. She lives in San Francisco and is a part of that restaurant scene, and she flies to cities or other countries just to try a restaurant. I don't do any of that. I'm just looking for stuff I can make for my family that's easy and good.

He sees himself as being very straight but many readers may not agree with his view of himself.The book starts out with an incident in Las Vegas casino where I have no idea what happened since I don't gamble but the narrator becomes friends with a man named Cully.Then it proceeds to tell the narrators struggles as a beginning writer, living in the  housing projects and working for the civil service.  This part I found interesting in part because I know many civil servants and people who live in housing projects.The narrator gets fired from the civil service then works for a famous writer named Osano.  This part of the book is boring.  We don't know much about Osano except that he wants to win the Nobel prize in literature and lives like a pig.  While we don't know what makes Osano a leading figure in US literature but we do know about his numerous personal failings.  This part of the book is bad.The best part of the book is the ending where the narrator goes to Hollywood and to me the book ended with a punch.

Many thanks to the author, I have to go start book 3, I have really high hopes for our talented little artist/hooker, Christopher.\", \"It doesn't matter what Gail Caldwell writes about -- the aftereffects of polio, hip replacement, her dog, or a life-changing five-eighths of an inch -- it is always so much more than the topic suggests. Whether she's sharing memories of her mom (and you'll love her mom's &#34;I'll let you know&#34; reply to...), or interpreting a dream, you'd never sit next to her on a plane and walk away thinking &#34;what a bore.&#34; Her introspection, insight, and approach to life (the very way she describes her experiences -- &#34;we were able to lengthen the leg... --- like saying, we were able to walk on water, or, we were able to lift the moon&#34;) combine to give a startling quality to even the most mundane and unappealing subjects.\", 'I did not like her style of writing.

Can't wait to continue reading about Eden and Avalon!\", \"By the time I reached the end of the Betsy Tacy series, I was so in love with the characters that I was hanging on every word. I'm so glad Maud Hart Lovelace extended the series into adulthood so that we could share the pleasure of what happened to Betsy and friends when they were all grown up. Betsy's adventures in the Great World initiated my passion for traveling in Europe, and Betsy's Wedding gave shape to my dream of happily ever after wedded bliss while gently warning me that nothing is ever perfect and troubles beset us all so matter how idyllic we may wish our lives to be.\", 'This is by far my most favorite genre of book to read, Dystopian, I do not really know why but it just fascinates me. I wish that there were more adult dystopian books but again this one is a Young Adult read. Not that I have anything against it but really someone needs to write an awesome Adult Dystopian novel!Divergent has been on my TBR (To be read) list for a long time and I was able to borrow this book from my friend finally and read it and I am so glad I finally was able to read this book! I am giving it 5 stars! Veronica Roth writes so well, there is no draggy parts at all, it has everything I could ask for. First of all, I think something that all dystopian books must have to be a good read is good action, during Tris&#8217;s Initation in Dauntless she does a lot of gutsy things, she jumps on to and off of trains, jumps off buildings, and climbs the ferris wheel at the old Navy Pier and that is just naming a few, I won&#8217;t tell you everything because I do not want to tell any spoilers. Roth also describes the landscape of Dystopian Chicago amazingly. I am obsessed with Chicago and have been there 3 times in the last 6 years to visit and the way she describes the places in Chicago and where Tris and her family and friends are at I can envision so clearly. There is also romance but not so much that it ruins the book and the meaning behind the book. Tris and Four are such a different couple then in most books I read and at the same time I can identify with them a little bit. I do not really have one bad thing to say about this book. If you like dystopian novels go out and try this one. I am looking forward to going with my co-blogger Colleen to see the movie so we can disect it and write a review of the book vs. the movie for everyone!Thanks always for reading!RochelleP.S.

This is not a lite book, but it is amazing how fast you can fly through it.  Brandon Sanderson is a great author that has developed a form of &#34;magic&#34; that is breathtaking and unique.  I love this series and will be a die hard fan to the end.  Be warned though, that this is supposed to be an epic series with some 10 books (currently only 2 released).  If you have issues with pausing amazing stories right in the middle, then you might want to put this on your wish list and keep and eye on it.  I know that I nearly cried when I read the last page and realized I would have to wait a year or more for the next installment.This book will refresh anyone's love of fantasy!\", \"What a great story. I'm hoping for a continuation of their story but at least it didn't end in a cliffhanger. Elaine Breson did a great job in writing this book. It was a very believable story and had me from the very first chapter.\", \"A Taste of Honey is a uniquely seductive thriller where sex is power and danger hides in the details. Evocative descriptions draw the reader swiftly into its world of deception and espionage, one which damaged heroine Nikki Siriene may not fully yet comprehend.Be prepared for a level of eroticism most thrillers won't touch - in fact, it's rare that when a book gets this dirty, there's room for a plot at all. Somehow, though, Hennessy makes it work. Catching your breath is tough between the suspense, steam and mystery, and as the stakes got higher I was more and more impressed with Hennessy's perceptive understanding of female sensuality and what goes on in our heads.\", 'I love to read thrillers and mystery novels, and I usually avoid those with politics. However, I decided to give this novel a try, and I was extremely impressed with the juggling act that Oren Sanderson puts on throughout the storyline. He is very skilled with having a multitude of aspects in the plot, such as politics, love, mystery, and many others, but not lose interest in the main story line.Dancing bear was completely captivating and kept me reading to the very last page. The fact that it is extremely well written and organized definitely benefited the complexity of the storyline. The characters are very well developed. I definitely could relate with David and wondered if that woman could be trusted. I found myself thinking I knew what was going to happen, and then something else completely caught me off guard.Most of all, I love the thrill of the chase that this book provides its reader. I feel like I am constantly chasing after the answers and sometimes I feel somewhat like David chasing after Kate. When books hand you the answers to the questions right away, it makes the book less exciting. Let me tell you this book is the complete opposite!Overall, I was extremely happy with this book and I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family.', 'This book about friends in Wisconsin is loving yet spare. The writing is stunning. The story turns and twists but seems inevitable and real and what friendship and caring and small towns are all about. One of my favorite books this year.

Unfortunately the book was awful.  What could have been a fun empowering book featuring full figure women turned out to have a pathetic train wreck.  The main character had such low self esteem there is no way she\\'d ever have a dating business.  She kept continually stating how \"guys like him wouldn\\'t fall for a heavy girl.\"  Wow. This author has no idea the opportunity she had to show a strong confident larger woman who knew she was worth a lot and didn\\'t need a man to define her. Skip this book it\\'s too full of bad characters and self loathing and no redeeming value because the author further perpetuates the stereotype that full figure women would never attract a good looking man and if she did she was so lucky.

Immensely enjoyed!', \"As a tutor, I order texts frequently. This was the first time I ordered binder ready. I ordered it because the price and condition were quite favorable compared to any other format. I haven't put it in a binder. For tutoring, I can take out the current chapter we are working on, and just put that in a binder. I think it would be hard to handle if all of it was put in a very large binder. As a CPA, accounting texts all seem the same to me. The presentations in this one were good and I was able to find Power Points of most of the chapters on line at no cost.

This is one of the best books I've had the pleasure of reading, and I've read thousands. There's not a lot I can say. These are the men and women who willingly offer to make the ultimate sacrifice every step of the way; patriotism at its finest. They live for the moment, protecting our freedom and security, sacrificing time with their families so that we may spend time with our families. I'll read anything from Scott McEwen if it's as good as this. I've long been a Richard Marcinko fan and I'll now have to add Scott McEwen to my list of favorite authors. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a dose of reality, to understand the threats we face as a nation and what our best of the best are doing about it.\", \"This book was wonderful! It's not about cancer. It's not about teens. It's about families dealing with a tragic illness and how it becomes their &#34;new normal&#34;.

Yes, the Supreme Court in a limited decision came down on the side of the Sacketts that they should receive a formal review, but there was much more to the story. Readers should check the Harvard Law review of this case before accepting Box's view.

It&#8217;s TNG&#8217;s chance to experience the &#8220;mirror universe&#8221; we got to see on-screen in both TOS and DS9, and, as I expected it to be, it was well written, with a few moments that really delighted me.One was the introduction of the dolphin, Hwiii, a hyperstring researcher who &#8216;swims&#8217; through the ship in a sort of water skin. Another was when Data, meeting Hwiii, tilts his head for a moment and then &#8216;speaks dolphin,&#8217; because, of course he does.I liked that Geordi and Deanna were the initial away team to the mirror Enterprise, and that they both got to use the knowledge they gleaned both from study and experience. Some of my favorite episodes were when Troi actually got to be a psychologist, and in this novel, she uses that training as much as she uses her innate empathetic abilities.Similarly, Geordi&#8217;s incredible depth of knowledge is highlighted in this book, as he works, sometimes with colleagues, and sometimes alone, to figure out a way to save, not just the ship, but the universe itself.I&#8217;m not sure when this was originally written but it felt like early TNG-fic. Data is very &#8216;sciency&#8217; but doesn&#8217;t have as much depth as he does in later novels &#8211; even in later pre-emotion-chip ones. It&#8217;s obviously before the contemporary push for continuity within the novels, but it&#8217;s still an entertaining read.Trek fiction is my crack. This was a delightful fix.Goes well with Sashimi and tempura and Kirin beer.', 'good recipes for new and seasoned dieters alike. Does have a few old favorites, but many are worth a try.

Delicious. . . absolutely delectable!As a child, Portia had a dream to run her grandmother&#8217;s restaurant (The Glass Kitchen) in Texas; however, after settling for a different life (married to a senator which betrayed her with her best friend, and did not allow her to use her cooking talents); a life derailed, she finds herself divorced, and moving to Manhattan to join her two sisters, Olivia and Cordelia.Portia is sure she was responsible for her grandmother&#8217;s untimely death and gives up her passion of cooking, due to this misconception. She inherited the ancestral gift (a knowing about events thru food), and her Gram instructed her how to use her abilities, leaving some helpful cookbooks and tips (how to heal certain illnesses with specific foods, among other things).Portia escapes Texas, and moves to the Upper West Side in a rundown brownstone townhome (garden lower level apartment), she inherits from her Great Aunt Evie, filled with fond childhood memories. However, she has no job skills and no divorce settlement (her first job was a hoot)! Her two sisters have sold their share of the townhome, to the handsome investment banker man who lives upstairs on the upper two floors (Gabriel Kane). The other two sisters are not without problems either.Gabriel lost his wife a year earlier, and is raising two daughters, Miranda (16) and Ariel (12, almost 13), and things are not going well in this household--total dysfunction and lack of communication. He wants to buy Portia&#8217;s garden apartment; however, she does not want to sell as this is the only thing she owns.The last thing Portia wants is to get involved with a man and his daughters. She has problems of her own &#8211; like how to survive in NYC! However, the minute she meets this man &#8211; her food thoughts come back strong, and no matter how much she tries to escape, the more she is pulled into this world of food, cooking, and lust.However, fate steps in and forces Portia to do what she loves best in life &#8211; COOKING, as a means to support herself &#8211; working for handsome and complex Gabriel, while planning her test kitchen with the two sisters, sending aromas to the streets of NYC, while seeking investors for their desired new restaurant (The Glass Kitchen)--if they can find the capital. Some good comfort Texas food, gourmet style in for fast pace NYC&#8212;putting her cooking skills to work to bring in the customers (and investors).Of course, to really make it yummy, nightly midnight visits (down the fire escape)to the garden level, from the complicated, hard nose, but sexy Gabriel, with some irresistible delights and surprises.All is not rosy and uncomplicated in this Upper West Side neighborhood. There are many twists, and obstacles along the way in this messy family of Kanes &#8211;from Gabriel&#8217;s mother, his brother Anthony, Gabriel&#8217;s former wife, and mother of the girls, with a secret past and events leading to her death, which shake Ariel&#8217;s world, as well as Portia.With quirky neighbors (Stanley and Marcus), supportive sisters, hot sex, some strong women, yummy gourmet recipes, love of food and recipes for life, with a young girl&#8217;s determination to put her family back together, to one&#8217;s woman&#8217;s courage and journey to fulfillment and passion &#8211; a meal you will want to savor!Linda Francis Lee created an irresistible banter and chemistry between Gabriel and Portia, which will keep you smiling and rooting for this sizzling, yet odd couple. And oh, Aerial will melt your heart, with her intelligence and winning personality, as she finds her way.There are many parallels here, and would be ideal for book clubs or discussions. Portia and Ariel, are very similar&#8212;both are youngest of sisters, guilt ridden, undervalued by others for their intelligence, keen sense of humor, talent, style, and passion &#8211;both courageous and determined to make things better, as they discover their true self.From the inviting front cover to the delectable and mouth-watering recipes &#8211; a captivating novel of love, forgiveness, family, courage, and the determination to follow your heart and dreams.I was traveling while reading this book, and had to get up extra early, in order to finish THE GLASS KITCHEN, this morning before getting back on the road. Could not wait to see what would happen to these unforgettable and lovable characters. A five star winner! Looking forward to reading more from this insightful and talented author.If you are a fan of contemporary fiction, chick lit, romance, humor, southern women&#8217;s fiction, love of gourmet food, and family dynamics, you will be assured to enjoy this magical novel, where life is not always perfect &#8211; as the fun is in the &#8220;messiness&#8221;, with some courses and recipes to sweeten the deal.Fans of authors Sarah Pekkanen, Emily Giffin, Mary Kay Andrews, Sarah Rayner, Jane Green, Sarah Addison Allen, Susan Rebecca White, Mary Ellen Taylor, Joanne Demaio, Beth Hoffman, Nancy Thayer, Wendy Wax, Mary Simes, or Dorothea Benton Frank will find THE GLASS KITCHEN, fresh, irresistible, funny, and quite satisfying.\", 'I am not an expert in long-term care, but this book seemed clear and very thorough.

Each chapter reads like that day's ramblings, not related to anything that's come before. Maybe he wrote this as therapy. Maybe he was bored by taking time off to rediscover his muse. (Btw, he found it. He recently played Carnegie Hall to some of his best reviews). Either way, this is Neil's mind, seemingly fully exposed. It's quirky, to say the least. And repetitious. This could have been cut in half. Still, you won't really mind because Neil really does have a lot to say, and much to recall of his storied career, which peaked by the early 70s. Yet, he's still creating great music, and his voice is still one of the wonders of rock. He is completely right in his crusade to upgrade the recorded music listening experience. Music did sound better before digital, and we have gone seriously backwards. He wants us to be able to feel music again. I hope the industry listens. Lossless digital tracks are coming for the masses. This is a worthwhile read for Neil fans.\", 'I was provided a free copy of Creedor (The Reglon Empire Series) along with a request to read and review the book.  I would rate the book 2.5 stars with a summary that the author has the beginnings of what could be an interesting series, but would caution that Creedor itself is an average stand alone novel that lacks a cohesive storyline.  In the first 20% of the novel we are introduced to characters and a plot that I assumed would be the basis for the rest of the book, but this is not the case.  After being introduced to Jarlord (obvious antagonist) and the wizard Vandalen (obvious protagonist), we move on to new characters and plots that end up taking shape and making some sense, but by that time the reader is at the end of the book.....which ends rather abruptly just as I felt like I was beginning to make sense of the story.I will admit that I am not normally an avid reader of fantasy or science fiction, so I was likely not as patient as I might otherwise be with what I considered a disjointed storyline that I had difficulty following at times.  Nevertheless, there is enough promise shown by the author of Creedor that I will likely invest the time to read the next book in the series to see the outcome of what happens to Slogar, Camdus and Mara along with whether Vandalen commands a more prominant role in the next book.', 'What a captivating novella. Walker had me laughing, cringing, and even in shock throughout. I couldn`t help but get wrapped up in the tale. Walker has also given me a new appreciation for zombies. In general, they tend to be my least favourite of the supernatural creatures but with this twist I found myself enjoying them immensely.I really appreciated the way that you get to know the characters from the Salt Lake After Dark series better in this little sidebar. Although it isn`t strictly essential to the series as a whole, it definitely helps you get to know everyone in a much less serious manner.Overall, this was a catching tale that has me even more stoked to get back to the series proper.', \"I enjoyed reading this book as I did the first book in the series.

Unfortunately, this book didn't accomplish that and truthfully, it was rather boring.  If you want to read a great series, I highly recommend the Chronicles of the Kings books (1-5), by Lynn Austin. My husband and I both enjoyed them tremendously. They are available on Kindle for a very reasonable price.\", 'This book is a fantastic continuation of The Alaskan Heart Saga. Tiffany Carmouche has outdone herself with this story. I cannot begin to describe the range of emotions I experienced as I read this book. I can not go into too much detail for fear of spoilers! This is a must read!!', 'I always thought of vegetarian food as bland and boring but after reading this cook book I have found it to be anything but ordinary. The author gives a delicious description of fried eggplant with mozzarella and herbed tomatoes to show how good vegetarian cooking can be. The book outlines a 14 day plan where you can follow along with the different types of recipes. There is even a specific section on raw vegetable recipes which I found interesting. This book makes you think outside of the box and I recommend it for anybody who wants to eat a healthier diet.', \"I retired from teaching at the primary level and wish I'd had this book years ago.

However, quality product at an affordable price.', 'I have many good things to say about the book, &#8220;12 Titanic Lessons for Christians&#8221; written by Charles C. Hagan, Jr. I&#8217;m a fan of the 1997 movie about the ill-fated ship and I&#8217;ve seen the movie many times. Because of that, I was immediately drawn to the book&#8217;s title. After I finished reading Hagan&#8217;s book, I can easily say that the author delivers on his promise to motivate, challenge, and empower his readers. He made an excellent choice for a topic. The book&#8217;s cover art alone is intriguing. Even though I&#8217;ve read some other books about the Titanic, I learned some new information here that I didn&#8217;t know. The author has obviously done his homework.I LOVED the poem from Dr. Benjamin Mayes that is on the back cover. I&#8217;d never read that before. There&#8217;s an important lesson in those rhymes that all of us can benefit from. I think it was very appropriate to feature it in this book.The author poses many thought-provoking questions. For instance, if you were among the over fifteen-hundred passengers on that ocean liner and you knew the end of your life was at hand, would you have lived your life differently?  Whoa, reality check! Our lives can be over in the blink of an eye. We get so tied up and self-absorbed at times that we can miss some of the warning signs of danger ahead. Sometimes it takes a Titanic-sized event in our own lives for us to pay attention to what&#8217;s really going on around us.  Perfect peace can only be found through God alone and His gift is there for all of us.  That some choose to reject or ignore the gift is one of the consequences of sin in a fallen world.The writing is good and the book is easy to read. I liked the format a lot &#8211; references at the bottom, fascinating trivia, historical facts, effective use of bold type, historical drawings and photos.  Most importantly, the scriptures the author chose to accompany his work are right on point in my opinion. The lesson titles are aptly named and I appreciated his modern-day parallels. There were a few minor grammar issues, but I didn&#8217;t see anything huge. There was also one confusing sentence for me with some awkward wording. Other than that, I was engaged and eager to read the whole book.There are so many takeaways. One of my favorite lines: &#8220;That we need to be grateful for every moment that we spend on earth.&#8221; Amen to that! I think this book would appeal to a vast audience, Christians and also Non-Christians looking for perspective on the trials of life.', 'I love the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books.  While the intrigue may not be as complex as in other detective type books, no one can match the color and imbedded messages that are found in this series.', 'On December 7, 1941 the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. Stationed at Pearl Harbor, Morris Sullivan owes his survival to Robert Dobbins, a black seaman who died pulling his comrades from the water. Seeking closure, Morris is determined to thank Robert&#8217;s family for his sacrifice, but his effort to honor a fallen hero blooms into a romance that will define the man he becomes and challenge everything he believes.Spanning the better part of five decades, A Life Apart, is a tedious historical, but under that it is a heartbreakingly beautiful novel of prejudice, strength, forgiveness and love that defies convention. I personally found Marlow&#8217;s peppering of the story with tenuously relevant headlines from the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s distracting, but the depth and earnestness of the love triangle she created between Morris, Beatrice and Agnes provided a powerfully moving thesis that struck me to the core.', 'I was not very happy with the book I received.

In my opinion, the book is at its strongest when it is working with vietnamese flavors, but like I said, all the recipes I've tried so far have been really good.

In 'Hard Choices' she tells us that she then planned to return to the Senate and was surprised when Obama offered the Secretary of State position to her. Supposedly she liked the idea of following one of her heroes, William Seward - another N.Y. senator who lost out to the ultimate president (Lincoln), and then served in his cabinet. (Who ever heard of William Seward? And why the focus on 'political heroes' instead of the opportunity to better America?) We're supposed to believe that personal political calculation had nothing to do with her acceptance - 'When your President asks you to serve, you should say Yes.'Hillary's narration shows her as consistently hawkish, consistent with her previously insisting on serving on the Armed Services Committee while a senator, and voting for the Iraq War. But I also saw her as constantly sticking her nose into every other nation's affairs - to the point she came across as domineering and insulting; not surprisingly, she doesn't see it that way in 'Hard Choices.'As for Benghazi, it's lot of double-talk, taking all positions at the same time, but failing to address the question of 'Why did the U.S. even have a State Dept. office in a non-capital city in Libya?' Putin - he's a bad guy, but she fails to see that his help is essential in addressing problems in Syria and Iran, issues with Russian hackers interfering with U.S. commerce and Internet traffic, and probably Iraq. Thus, her/our demonizing him (and others) simply makes progress in other areas more difficult, if not impossible. Pivoting to Asia - another demonizing tactic that supposedly makes America (and Hillary) look tough, but makes little sense. Today we're seeking help from Iran to stem the Sunni uprising in Iraq. We need China's ongoing help (and that of others) to address Global Warming; on the other hand, we also need to stop letting Asia in general (and China in particular) decimate our economy. Free Trade is working - for them, not us. Regardless, who in America wants to risk losing eg. L.A. and Seattle to defend some miniscule island in the Pacific, thousands of miles away?We also get the cloy ploy for sympathy - 'there's a double standard applied to women in politics.' Tell that to Angela Merkel and others.Overall, 'Hard Choices' is rather boring and overly vague on specifics. Meanwhile, her political spin continues - this week it's a lame explanation of why she charges so much for speaking engagements.If anybody out there doesn't think 'Hard Choices' isn't a planned step on the road to the 2016 nomination, I've got a lot of bridges I'd like to sell you.\", 'What can I say about Conn and Aries except you need to read the walker bookif you like any of the others', 'This book catches you falling in love with the spunky characters and intriguing plot.

There is so much raw emotion, and battle scars in this book I feel like I need therapy!  Sergeant First Class Reza Iaconelli, where to start&#8230; My heart broke for him. He was pure male power wrapped up in a lot of personal demons.  I seriously had to catch my breath a couple of times with him.  He is full of contradictions.  Physically he is all male. Big and physically strong.  Emotionally he is living one day to the next trying to function as best he can.  He tries to be the best Sergeant he can for his soldiers.  He is sympathetic to their insecurities yet battles with how to adequately prepare them for the realities of war and military life.  Reza is a recovering alcoholic, he struggles everyday with his addiction.  He is also surrounded by soldiers that have the same struggles.  Aside from struggling with alcoholism he is also dealing with PTSD.  Reza came with his own scars before joining the military and we learn about his home life and how it shaped him.Captain Emily Lindbergh is the opposite of Reza, although she struggles with her own personal issues, she comes from a life of privilege.  Her father was in the military but she never personally experienced the life of a soldier.  She is trying to bring help to soldiers such as Reza and his men, but not everyone thinks this is a good idea or is very welcoming to her.  Emily was a fantastic character.  She tried to show the soldiers her commitment to their mental health and was often the target of military personnel&#8217;s wrath.  Emily is alarmed at the high number of suicides and tries to provide the soldiers with some psychological support.As a couple Emily and Reza where exact opposites yet perfectly matched.  Where he is physically strong and emotionally weak Emily is physically weak but emotional very strong.  They had excellent chemistry and I loved that they formed a strong friendship.  I loved that they each met the other where they were at.  Emily never tried to &#8220;fix&#8221; Reza she accepted and gave him the support he needed although at times did not want.These characters were so real, Scott really peels back all their emotions and gives us two very vulnerable people.  When I read &#8220;Back to You&#8221; I felt the same way.  The characters were both so imperfect and so real.  Ms. Scott really captures the damage that soldiers experience during combat, after, and before.Honestly, this is a tough read.  I put the story down a couple of times, not because it was not well written or interesting, because it was all of those; but emotionally very challenging.  The characters were worth it.  It&#8217;s not a light read but it does provide a very &#8220;unromantic&#8221; look at the hardships of war and military life.  Overall, I think I can say that I recommend everything and anything written by Jessica Scott.  She really knows how to strip down her characters and show us who they are.  After the emotional odyssey it&#8217;s beautiful to see Reza and Emily find their way together!  Another fantastic journey with Ms. Scott!!', \"I love mysteries set at Christmas, although if I'd known this was one, I would've saved it for December.

I am more interested in the story and where the author is taking me. But I will overlook that and remove a star because of it.

Available in English translation for the first time (indeed, the last of Nesb&#8217;s novels to be translated into English), this is Det. Harry Hole&#8217;s second dark adventure, one that sends him away from Norway yet again, this time to the seedy underworlds of Bangkok, Thailand in pursuit of the killer of the Norwegian ambassador there.Readers of &#8220;The Bat&#8221; will recall that Nesb is a master of evoking atmosphere and place. But unlike that superior first novel in the Harry Hole series, &#8220;The Cockroaches&#8221; never seems to rise to the occasion. Sure, it&#8217;s entertaining, but the Thai setting he evokes is so squalid, and the characters so dejected, that you might want to consciously do something intermittently cheerful as you read.Despite its shortcomings, this is a must-read for all Nesb fans.', 'This is the fourth exciting novel by talented author Douglas Wickard.  He certainly knows how to make your spine tingle.  He stands with the most popular authors of this genre as he writes another gripping suspense.  Sacred rituals await a teenaged girl as the villain scopes her out at the mall watching her dance around her boyfriend.  That evening George Madden drops off his wife, Edna, at the weekly prayer meeting.  As usual, he has his own weekly meeting at the prostitute club, \"Silk Stockings.\"  After he gets his satisfaction, it\\'s hard for him to see while driving on the dark country road at night.

He hoists her over his shoulder to his car and takes her to the hospital. He feels he\\'s likely to be in deep do-do when he has to explain this to his wife Edna. Doctor Sydia Garrison who specializes in surgery at Medical University of South Carolina is sickened by the barbaric assault on this young teenager.  A local news reporter, Janice Porter, gets a tip from a fellow who works at the hospital, so she quickly attempts to be the lead reporter and goes to the hospital.

Very soon, as the police search the area where George found the mutilated girl, another young girl\\'s body is found.  This leads to FBI Agent Harry Wright into the fast moving investigation of the serial killer tagged, \"The Mutilator.\"  This is very compelling story, with the characters well defined, in fast reading style of writing by the author.

The women in the family are strong-willed and sassy, while their men support them and know when to back down. I seriously love the things that come out the Parker sister's mouths, it is hilarious.

Regardless of how adventurous most of us consider ourselves to be in the world of culinary delights, eating bugs doesn't exactly sound like the catch of the day.The author takes a look at hunger, culture, the work of other governments in entomophagy, the actual nutrition that bugs contain, and lots more.  The casual conversational style of her writing makes Martin's book interesting and easy to understand.  While I am not sure personally that bugs are what's for dinner here tonight, I can easily see the advantages of a readily available food source that is easily sustainable and can basically be grown anywhere.For me, it brought up a more interesting train of thought....why do I think bugs are so disgusting to eat?

He&#8217;s an only child, however, and his foreman is always harping that Walker needs an heir. He&#8217;s young and healthy, though, so he&#8217;s in no hurry, until a bull almost kills him. Since he can&#8217;t bring himself to court again, he makes arrangements for a mail order bride.Sarah Livingston&#8217;s father just doesn&#8217;t understand how much she wants a husband and children of her own, and he doesn&#8217;t think anyone is good enough, unless it&#8217;s a man who doesn&#8217;t want to marry her. When her father decides to send her to Uncle Brice&#8217;s in Georgia after her last escapade, she knows she&#8217;ll have to do something desperate. She decides to run to her friend in New York, but, on the way, she meets a young woman crying because she has to become a mail order bride. Sarah switches places with her, and when she meets Walker, she knows she did the right thing. Can she put off telling him the truth long enough to make him fall in love with her? As she tries, things become more and more complicated and messy.For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Sarah is stubborn but lovable, because she has a big heart and wants to do the right thing, even when she makes bad choices. Walker is just as stubborn in his own way, and I could understand why he was leery of being deceived. Some of the things that happened with Caleb wasn&#8217;t rational, and I was surprised Sarah ran away when she had promised Walker she wouldn&#8217;t. The cover of the book is also wrong, because Sarah was a redhead. Overall, however, the story was riveting and a page-turner, and I had no problems giving it five stars.', 'Returning to the plantation after the war and after waiting for her father&#8217;s lawyer to read his will, Charlotte is now on her way back to her home in the Deep South to see what remains, if anything, of the home in which she once lived.  While she knows there has been destruction of personal items or the items have been stolen, Charlotte has promised her father she will again try to raise the rice crop and live on the land.The paragraph above states the setting of the fictional tale that is actually based on a real historical figure named Elizabeth Waties Allston Pringle.  Can you imagine what this woman witnessed in her lifetime?  How about thinking of what her life was like before and after the Civil War?  Charlotte is based loosely on the real life experiences of Elizabeth, and the author, with some minor adaptations, places her novel near where the real plantation where Elizabeth lived.  After you read the fictional tale, the author shares how she came to learn about this unique woman and her life.There are characters that portray what southern people must have felt during Reconstruction along with what many veterans suffered during a horrific war.  They had to learn to live in a new society that was still forming.  With so few eligible men to marry, we see a jealous female antagonist see that she indeed ends up with the one man she sets her eyes on no matter who gets hurt in reaching her goal.  Yellow fever is an epidemic that costs many lives in New Orleans in 1868.  With the destruction so complete, few can prove they own the land on which they return to.Dorothy Love writes a moving masterpiece that keeps the reader reading until they see how the unknown ending is revealed.  I simply cannot express how much the real woman Elizabeth, along with others who lived in the south before, during and after the war, had to learn how to start all over.  Readers see how a woman who has her faith shredded by heartbreak learns to trust God again in a time when each day brings new trials, triumphs or tragedy.  What a tenacity people displayed to endure and then to thrive each day.  Perhaps like our female lead character they did so by looking to God and putting one foot in front of the other time and time again.  A historical novel rich with history, faith, perseverance and romance!  Don&#8217;t pass up reading this book!', 'There are a number of just-turned-30,or 40,or 50 humor books out there, and almost all of them have their engaging aspects. They do display a considerable range of styles, from the purely jokey to the angsty and way too self-involved. This book is a nice antidote to those two extremes because it is at times both funny and insightful in a rueful and self-deprecating way.  By that I mean Ms. Gurwitch knows her way around a one-liner and around an extended goof of a story, (see \"AuDum at the Apple Genius Bar\"), but she also has a handle on wry commentary on the state of the recently 50. The emphasis is on wry commentary - there\\'s no over the top hysteria, no relentless kvetching, no excess. We all get older, and some of the stuff associated with that is funny, or at least can be given a good-humored spin. That\\'s what\\'s going on here, and it is all done with honesty, a keen eye for the absurd, and a grown up appreciation of people and their foibles and preoccupations.  So, if you\\'d like a gentle, humorous reminder that you aren\\'t alone as you hit 50, this could be a very nice choice.Please note that I received a free advance ecopy of this book in exchange for a candid review.

Sometimes divorce can be for good and this book does a great job of shedding new light on that subject.', 'I don\\'t know the last time I read a book so completely compelling.  It just came out of the blue.  It\\'s like those potato chips that once you start eating them you can\\'t stop.  The first thing I did was to go look for more of Julia Heaberlin\\'s books.  I was all, \"How did I not know about you?\"  This is a brilliant storyteller who is just getting warmed up.  This is only her second novel?  She writes a story as complex with intrigue and mystery as any of the greats.  The last time I remember finding a writer who was so compelling was Jodi Picoult (and I am still not reading her because of what she did at the end of My Sister\\'s Keeper).This story is mystery over mystery with many fabulous layers.  The characters are rich and brilliantly drawn.  There was depth to the characters that just kept getting better.Knowing the storyline is only a part of it, but nowhere near the entire story.  This is a book that caused me to reread the ending and then the beginning.  Then the ending.  And I skimmed a few chapters.  It was all there.-Gertrude', 'I enjoyed reading this book however,I was a little disappointed the reason Ruth seemed whimsy washy in deciding whether to leave the Amish Life.  But I must say I loved the way she nervier once strayed away from her faith.  I enjoyed it but I must say it was not my favorite however, I still love my Amish books and will read Book 2 of this series.', \"We are enjoying this book as a supplement to our History lesson.  I'm using the Charlotte Mason method of instruction and find that this corresponds nicely with our other curriculum.  Nice short chapters with information that keeps my 8 year old interested.\", 'This novel was initially released in 1996 and has been re-released now for two reasons.  The first of which is the fact that the author, Magdalen Nabb, passed away in 2007 and it is an opportunity to continue having her work presented to a new legion of readers.The second reason is the recent revival in this true crime cold case that has brought about a non-fiction novel (with the same title) that was co-written by Douglas Preston and Mario Spezi.  That book has garnered interest from Hollywood and a film is speculated to be made starring George Clooney in the role of Doug Preston!The Monster Of Florence was the Jack the Ripper of Italy having been charged with seven double homicides between 1968 and 1985. There were many other murders that could have possibly been committed by this individual but local law enforcement has been unable to prove any of that.  Actually, they have not been able to prove anything and this remains the most infamous cold case in Italian history.Along comes Magdalen Nabb attempting to put a fictional spin on this case.  Her recurring crime series that featured Marshal Guarnaccia is the perfect outlet for a speculative novel about the famed Monster of Florence.  Like the actual officials following this case, Guarnaccia seems to be foiled at every turn and is surprised when his Director assigns him the task of reopening an old cold case such as this one.The novel contains many court transcripts and internal communications that reviewed the various suspects in this case --- and there are a lot of them.  Nabb blends both fictional and non-fictional suspects to present a case for Guarnaccia that appears overwhelming for anyone to solve.If readers have read the non-fiction novel by Preston & Spezi they will realize how inept, corrupt and misguided the Italian law enforcement and legal communities were in regards to this case.  Preston and Spezi themselves were even detained and briefly accused of being the Monster themselves!  A frustrating endeavor for anyone seeking to bring clarity and understanding to this case.THE MONSTER OF FLORENCE provides a lot of technical detail that at times bogs down the action and pace of the novel.  The main enjoyment in reading a novel like this rests in having an understanding of the actual case it was based on and appreciating the attempt to shine some light on a dark chapter in Italian history.Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader', 'This book \"Road to Siran\"is my second book from the same author and he portrays the characters in such a way that it captivates all our hearts. His book \"Voice of conscience\" is a real masterpiece and I enjoyed reading it to the core of my heart. This book \"Road to Siran\" comes as a sequel to his previous work. He stimulates the reader by evaluating the characters in such a way that it gives the readers a feel of freshness.The story starts with the old reminiscence of Erin from JFK international Airport and from where the author\\'s writing took off with a momentum. The Character Erin is represented as a person with great interest on Ballet dancing and reading books. Her fathers death had made a strong imprint on her mind which resulted in exploring to know more about her Dad. Another character by name Elicia, friend of Erin is portrayed in a memorable way, she often changes her boyfriend and comes out as an high energetic character. The communication amid Erin and Elicia in the high school brings out our own memories during those good old days, they were depicted as naughty and  gets captivated to their opposite gender. The righteous Turkish Ozcan, very pretentious in nature to whom Erin got attracted at their first introduction.The author brings in equal mixture of Romance and thrill in his book, especially the non-verbal communication between Erin and Ozcan is a unique way of illustration . The unfathomable writing of his book makes the readers to associate with it emotionally which is the key triumph for the author. All the readers would enjoy and will experience enchanting feeling of love in this book. The greatest truth that actions of one will be the deciding factor of course of events in his life is nicely depicted by Kaya.', \"I enjoy reading science, mainly &#34;popular science&#34;, Hawking usually loses me at about the second page though my career was Mechanical Engineering.As a designer I always believed that a building, steam or chemical system should be built and used as it was designed to be used. There may be some things that seem odd or are hard to understand to you,...BUT.... But, the designer just may have had some information that you as a builder or operator are not privy to.The same applies to most of &#34;us&#34;. Dr. Lieberman clearly describes how we came about and how far we humans have drifted away from the designers intent. We enjoy escargot but avoid worms and most insects. Our ancestors would not have turned their noses up at either...raw.And and how that drift has caused us some pain and suffering. His terms are &#34;Mismatch&#34; and &#34;Dysevolution&#34;. We have come so far in fact that &#34;changing back&#34; isn't always easy.Lieberman stresses two things, diet, and exercise. Our cousins, the Chimps and Gorillas spend much of the day walking and searching for food, they chew a while, sometimes rest a while and then start over. Walking is good! I believe he states it is almost as good for our bodies as running. At 82 I like that! Sometimes running is good, especially when a hyena or wild dog becomes interested in you. If it's a Cheeta or Leopard you're in big trouble.Actually some food can be better for us by cooking. Meat is easier to chew and now what we eat rarely has fur in it or fleas or maggots, which probably would have been eaten.The book is written for &#34;us&#34;, it is easily understood by laymen.

We all live complex lives, however even the busiest of us could probably remember four words of self-help. Just think of all the diet books that could be eliminated from the shelves if we all abided by the self-help advice for weight loss--eat less, move more. When you really get down to it, isn't that what all the programs espouse? I loved the positive tone of the book and the beautiful illustrations that were contributed by fans of her blog. Whether or not you believe that self-help can be reduced to four words, I think that this book is worth a read.\", 'There is so much good about this volume.  It is essentially split up into two parts, so I&#8217;ll take it one at a time.Part 1:  The continuing battle with Uncle Aaron:While Miles and Aaron team up together at the beginning of the volume, they inevitably battle, as Aaron&#8217;s blackmailing of Miles is finally resolved.  Frankly, I was shocked by how it was resolved.I haven&#8217;t mentioned this in previous reviews, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say that I really like the fact that Miles&#8217; power set is different than Peter&#8217;s old power set.  Sure, there are some similarities, but then there are also some drastic differences.  The camouflage and venom blast are especially awesome.From here on out, there will be spoilers until I get to Part 2.  The death of Aaron was tragic and necessary.  As the Prowler, Aaron is a villain, and an enemy to Spider-Man.  The fact that he knows Miles&#8217; secret identity means that he couldn&#8217;t have stayed in the story unless he turned good.  Aaron wasn&#8217;t on that trajectory, so he had to die, for the sake of the story and the character.  But how he died, accidentally being killed by his nephew, is so tragic for Miles, who now has to live with this as a 13 year old.  In an interest parallel, the death of Uncle Ben influenced the way Peter Parker would live as Spider-Man, and I&#8217;m certain that the death of Uncle Aaron will impact the hero that Miles becomes.  Aaron&#8217;s dying words, &#8220;How about that?  You are just like me,&#8221; will surely haunt Miles for years.  He will now have to look his father in the eyes knowing that he is responsible for the death of his father&#8217;s brother.Part  2:  Working for Captain America:Although I&#8217;m not reading any other Ultimate Marvel books, it is clear that there is a storyline going on in which some sort of war has started.  Captain America is leading the good guys, and Miles joins by their side.  This section, called &#8220;Divided We Fall,&#8221; opens with the words, &#8220;Washington is decimated.  The government is a mess.  The Southwest is in chaos.  States are seceding from the union.  America is falling apart.&#8221;  This sets the stage for Miles going to war, but not before an opening scene where Miles&#8217; father tells him (Spoilers) the bad news that Spider-Man killed his uncle!Spoilers from here on out.  As with previous volumes, Peter&#8217;s cast appears in Miles&#8217; story.  In this volume, we get a crucial interaction as Aunt May and Gwen Stacy decide that it is time for Miles to have something that Peter built.  Web-shooters and the web formula!  I have to be honest, with all the other awesome powers that Miles had, I failed to realize that he didn&#8217;t have the ability to go web-swinging.  This will be even better now!  Since Miles&#8217; best friend, Ganke, is really smart, and knows his secret identity, he is tasked with the mission of creating the web fluid using Peter&#8217;s formula.Ultimate Maria Hill makes an appearance in this volume, and quickly realizes a connection between Spider-Man and Miles&#8217; family.Back in the war, chaos ensues, and Spider-Man is a big hero.  I really like it when Miles can work with Spider Woman (Peter&#8217;s clone, but in female form), this volume had a lot of that.  Plus, there was further character development with Miles&#8217; parents.  Another great Spider-Man book.I read this volume right after reading volumes 1 and 2, and it was a good experience to read the whole story (so far) straight through.', \"The Last Refuge is the 3rd installment in the Ben Coes Dewey Andreas series. The time out, Dewey's most recent friend, Kohl Meir from the previous story has been kidnapped by the Iranians who also happen to be plotting a nuclear armageddon for Israel. Given the delicate geopolitical situation with the US focused on an arms treaty with Iran, Dewey needs to both save Meir and secure the nuke without official sanction. With the assistance of off the books CIA private contractors Dewey organizes a plan for both.The pacing is excellent with nearly nonstop action. Both tradecraft and action scenes are well done and interlaced for page turning effect. With so many entries in this genre always revolving around inside plots with the supposed good guys plotting more mayhem than your typical terrorist, it's refreshing to see action with a classic John Wayne type character going up against true enemies.\", 'This book is an excellent read!

As a matter of fact, what she discovers about her family makes her literally ill with horror and fear.  For she mourns her father who loved her dearly but she also mourns the man as tyrant and killer who has tortured and killed thousands; at least he is responsible for these acts even if he has not literally carried them out himself in a single-handed way.  The word her friends use about the children&#8217;s fairy tales and practices of her father&#8217;s rule is &#8220;barbaric,&#8221; a painful word that sears through her mind and feelings for days and weeks.  How does one cope with her father&#8217;s guilt, that which took the lives of families and friends of people she actually knows in America?Now Laila is in America.  Several people are interested in her, the man who is attempting to convince her mother to cooperate with CIA interests, the man who doesn&#8217;t trust Laila initially but eventually will come to accept her at face value, and a normal American boy who wants to write a journalistic account of her father&#8217;s life and her experiences in the nameless country from which she is in exile.

I find these a great way to discover new authors.  Thanks', \"This one got pretty exciting and I was thrilled to see this happen.  I loved all the twists and turns it took.  While the romance was as good as I've come to expect from this series, I have to say that I found the advancements in the overall story arc for the series equally compelling.Jessica and Travis were a great couple.  They had me laughing, sighing at the tender moments and groaning over their mutual stubbornness.  Before I go much further, I should point out that this one is very much connected to the ones that came before it.  It assumes the reader is familiar with the history of several people and the ongoing situation that makes them time travelers.Jessica Battaglia is a nurse at a hospital in Harrisburg and her life leaves her content with the exception of painful situation of her grandfather walking away from his marriage and taking up with a much younger woman.  She can't forgive him for this and doesn't trust his new wife, but she agrees to come to dinner along with her best friend, Hailey for moral support.  At the dinner, all goes wrong and she ends up accused of murdering her own grandfather and taken into custody even while her friend is taken to the hospital because Eve drugged them.  While sitting in the interrogation room, something weird happens and she blacks out only to end up in the countryside almost a hundred and fifty years before her time trying to convince a guy that she's not crazy.Travis Wade, a Union deserter and thought dead, is making his way back to his uncle in Harrisburg to get his help when he stumbles on a crazy beautiful woman who thinks she's from the future.  It's not long before he learns that her bizarre story is indeed the truth when he encounters more time travelers just like her and they all know his uncle and his brother.  His life is turned upside down and his attraction to Jessica is at the center of this.  Each time he is near her though he ends up saying or doing the wrong stuff that causes an argument.  He has no idea what to do and recognizes that if he doesn't figure it out quick, she'll leave him behind to return to her own time.Jessica is all stirred up when it comes to Travis and she doesn't know what to think about the irritating man who both makes her go weak at the knees and gives her the urge to hit him all at the same time.  She has the added distraction of worrying what is going on with her grandfather's murder and her friend's precarious survival in her absence.  Her heart is divided and she has no idea what to do.In the meantime, she is enjoying the camaraderie and family of people who have taken her into their life and made her one of their own.  Sophie and Jamie kindly do all they can for her and Travis, Em and Hannah are busy with babies and pregnancies and they're all caught up in the events brought on by the War.  The mysterious Madame and others are at work in the shadows orchestrating things that effect everyone's lives.As I said earlier, the plot on this one was loaded with action and suspense which I loved.  The pace moved along pretty good.  I enjoyed the reveals about the bad guys' plottings.  Jessica and Travis were key figures that the good guys had to protect and the bad guys take out for the opposing people to get their victories.  The murder plot in the contemporary time just made things even more exciting.As to the romance and characters of Jessica and Travis, I really liked it for the most part.  They were both so stubborn and unwilling to see the other's perspective at times that I got frustrated.  And there was a period where denial of feelings caused stupid setbacks for them, but fortunately they had Sophie and Jamie around to knock some sense into their heads.  I suppose all the conflict leading up to the resolve just made the resolve that much sweeter.It was fun to get a peek in with everyone else as they all played a big part in the story including Crow and Shaye in the future.  Looking forward to what comes next.This book and the series it is part of would appeal to those who enjoy sweeter romances in a time-travel situation that is spent mostly in the American Civil War era.My thanks to the author for gifting me a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review thoughts.\", \"This novel has everything a sci-fi reader is looking for; Mysteries, Conspiracies, Space Travel, and Aliens.Love the story. Can't wait to see where it take me.Nu\", 'Wonderful book! I really enjoyed it. It had it all. It was about friendship, betrayal, finding love and finding yourself. The characters were well written and the story just flowed. It centers on the friendship between Charlotte and Nicole. They were best friends growing up but have been distant for 10 years. Nicole reaches out to Charlotte to come to Quinnipeague for a summer to help her write a cookbook. Charlotte feels she owes Nicole and agrees to come. This sets things up for a very interesting summer where friendships and marriage will be tested and love will be found. I highly recommend this book. Great beach read!', \"This story is fairly forgetable, I know because I read it once and then forgot it. It tried to be exciting, but it missed the mark. I didn't feel that the main character acted in a natural way; I don't care if you are a seasoned FBI agent, you don't insist on getting up and going to work the morning after your daughter is kidnapped.The other aspect of the novel, the cause of the financial meltdown of 2008, is probably more fact than fiction, but it is so complicated it would be hard to really understand unless you were a trained accountant. If the author really wanted to expose the corruption of the financial industry he probably should have chosen a different vehicle, because this isn't going to draw the attention of anybody.\", \"The book is a good thriller.

I enjoyed reading about colton and Riley.', \"I'll admit that when I first started reading the Daughter of Darkness Trilogy I had to stop and check that I didn't purchase an erotica instead of a romance.  There is a good story line here and there is a lot of sex but unlike some &#34;romance&#34; books I have read it doesn't go on and on (and sometimes on) with the sex. This of course just depends on the author.  There is sex and there is an okay amount of detail about the sex but I have read romances where the sex could span two or three pages and quite frankly I can only read so much of how the hero takes his velvet steel into her moist folds before I just decide to skip ahead.Now that I'm clear about the fact that there is sex here I'll also tell you that for most of this book I was wondering how the heck was this going to resolve!  I too was feeling torn!The book does require some editing I'll have to admit but it's really not something that should impact your enjoyment of the book. They say a strong mind is able to figure out what is meant to be said and any noticeable errors only occur occasionally.There are some great twists in this book, and  a really good ending which doesn't leave me going &#34;What?  That was how it ended?&#34;\", \"This series is awesome ! It's a love story that goes through happy times and horrible times.

His writing is nuanced, rich, and almost non-verbal in its stirring of feeling. He is particularly clever at what he chooses to tell and not tell. When is the next novel coming? He certainly set a high bar with this one. The appeal of the mini-series at which he is equally adept may keep him occupied for some time yet. Not that I would mind. True Detective was terrific.', 'Information on the CCRN dose not change that much, so using an outdated book will not effect you too much. I used this and looked up the blue print from AACN. This book is a bit winded, and goes into a lot of detail about anatomy and such that you might not really need to know it pass. If you want to be know all that information, then you are a far more studious nurse then I.  The book is broken up well so you can easily skip this part, and just study the patho. The CD is great! I fell like that helped me a ton!', 'I like that there is a song for being too late and washing hands too- definitely makes my little one want to sit on the potty more', \"This is a typical Kristen Ashley book so if you enjoy her stories then you'll like this.  Funny, sexy, and moves pretty fast.  A good summer read.\", \"First Sentence:Nicholas Grayson wasn't a nice person.Storyline:I must confess that when I read the blurb I was intrigued and knew I would like it BUT I felt like I already knew how the story would evolve and end. This, since I have read a lot of books with similar story lines. However I was very wrong. Even though the big picture was alike other books it was so unlike anything I have read. I absolutely loved it and was constantly surprised. Never a dull moment and I was instantly caught in the story and did not want to go to work lol!Some parts of the story was making me so sad and where heartbreaking. It almost made me cry! Other parts had me laugh out loud.Charachters:Ellie Holbrook is the heroine in the book and I loved her. She has a very rough past littered with abuse, drugs and so on. When she finds herself pregnant she is forced to grow up and she excels at it. She is so mature for her age and is awesome with her daughter Sophie. She is confident and knows what she want. She does not joke around and when she knows what she wants she goes after it.Nicholas Grayson is the ultimate douchebag! I absolutely hated him in the beginning. His attitude sucked and I could not stand him. He did what he wanted just because he could. No caring at all if his actions harmed others. Bleh! Selfish bastard! That was until he met Ellie. She started out as a bet and eventually became so much more. Nicholas started to realize that the front he had put up was not going to work with Ellie and she made him want to be better.Romance:There was a lot of romance and it was hot and sizzling! A bigger rollercoster I would have to look for. Ellie and Nicholas love story has so many ups and downs that you almost get dizzy. But it totally works and thats what makes their love so awesome. The can be so perfect together and other times they are a total disaster waiting to happen. As the book so adequately is called their love really is a beautiful disaster :)Action:Not much action as in real fighting but there was a lot of other types of action in the story. It felt like it was Ellie and Nicky against everyone else all the time. A lot of other characters had their own agenda as to why they should not be together and had no limits of how far they would go to get it.Cover:Simple and lovely! Don't you think?\", 'This book disappointed me so much. Jayne was very annoying in so many ways. Every chapter was a repeat of what happen in the last book, a waste of my time. I constantly found myself skipping paragraphs because it was repeating the same thing. This writer needs to get it together.', \"Seems like it's impossible for Mr. Connelly to write a bad book. &#34;The Gods of Guilt&#34; is one of his best. Once again, ethically-suspect Mickey Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer) is back at work with an impossible case, a new love (?) and personal problems up the wazoo ... not to mention someone is trying kill him.One of the joy of Connelly's books are the full fledged secondary characters that pop up and weave in and out his stories. Another part of his brilliance, even though his books have continuing characters, who overlap into different series, you can pick up any one of his books, and feel right at home.Highly recommended!\", 'I enjoyed the writing style and am looking forward to reading my next Matthew Williams book.  It is easy enough to follow the plot, but with just the right amount of twists and turns to keep me ready for more.  Definitely worth the money, which was extremely reasonable anyway.', \"~4 Stars~***I received a complimentary copy provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.***The Pairing is a companion novel to The Proposition and The Proposal. I would recommend reading the other two books first since Pesh Nadeem appears in The Proposal, so the story makes more sense if you know his background. Megan McKenzie is a single mom who is in the final stages of becoming a registered nurse. She hasn't dated since her son's father left her when she found out she was pregnant. Pesh is an ER doctor who hasn't dated seriously since the death of his wife years ago. You would think they would want the same thing in a relationship...love and commitment, but you would be very wrong. Megan wants a hot fling, and Pesh wants to settle down and give love another try. They are both chosen as godparents to Aidan and Emma's son, Noah. Pesh is a great friend to them, and Megan is Aidan's niece. When they meet at the baptism, there is an immediate attraction between the two, but it's going to be a battle of the wills to see which one gets their way, a relationship or just hot, smoldering sex! Megan leaves the reception with Pesh after she has too much to drink, and she thinks she will be having a night of hot sex with the sexy doctor, but things don't turn out quite like she had hoped. The two go their separate ways the next morning, but fate isn't through with these two, Megan is assigned to Pesh's ER to finish her final clinicals several months later. Let the games begin again...you'll have to read on to see if Megan or Pesh win.I have read the other two books in the series and loved them. I know reading reviews from other readers that many of them didn't like Pesh in The Proposal because they thought he was trying to take Emma away from Aidan. However, I have always been a fan of Pesh's. Who wouldn't be! He's sexy as hell, a successful doctor, a truly honorable soul, and again did I mention sexy as hell? He falls for Megan hard the first time he sees her and cannot forget about her. Megan is a firecracker. If you read any of the other books, you know she takes after her Uncle Aidan. She and Pesh are truly opposites who complement each other nicely. Megan brings out the spontaneous side of Pesh, and he brings out the softer side of her. There are many scenes that include Megan's toddler son, Mason. Those were some of the most heart-warming scenes to me, especially the one near the end of the book when they are eating dinner with Megan's family. Much of the story is about Pesh's pursuit of Megan and trying to get her to give him a chance at a real relationship. The sexy stuff doesn't happen until at least mid-way through the book, but it was well worth the wait. Katie knows how to write a sexy love scene!One of my favorite things about this book is that I got to see how Aidan, Emma, and many of the other characters are doing. I love Aidan and Megan's big Irish family! The epilogue was sweet and tied up things very nicely. I have read almost everything by Katie Ashley, and she has yet to disappoint me!\", \"This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  I highly recommend this book.  It was great from beginning to end.  One of the most heart wrenching stories.  I wish it could keep going. There were a few &#34;loose ends&#34; so it might. I just haven't ckd to see if there is anything further with this great story.\", 'I was impressed with not only the characters of the book, but also the description of Wyoming where the story takes place.

I needed 4 more words to leave this review.', \"For me this was a 2.5/3 it was just so boring and I just didn't enjoy it like I thought that I was. Which is sad because I was really looking forward to Rome/Cora's book I just knew that I was going to get all kinds of fire but know is what I got was a whole bunch of inner dialogue and people pushing each other away and then an unexpected pregnancy. Don't get me wrong I still love both of the characters I just wasn't a fan of the book. So far the only book in the series that I have loved is Rule. I hope with Nash we get something different I have my fingers crossed.\", \"Time and time again, Aleatha Romig delivers superb stories full of emotion and suspense. Behind His Eyes - Truth is just another example of how Ms. Romig is at the top of her game and shows no signs of slowing down. Giving us Tony's POV is a huge treat, and helps us dive into the mind of this disturbingly, sexy, possessive man.In BHE - Truth, we are reminded, yet again, how powerful Anthony Rawlings really is. He is a man on a mission. He wants something he takes it. All throughout this story it's like you can hear him in your head, the anger, the desperation, everything this man feels, you are right there with him. Some might say we get so invested in this character, and we are so conflicted on how we feel about him, it can take a toll on us. I can certainly say, for a fact, that this series has taken a toll on me, in a bone-chilling, heart-racing, mind-****ing way, but I wouldn't have it any other way. These are the stories that stick with you long after you finish reading. It's what you start comparing all other books to. Nothing beats the raw emotion and intense feelings this series pulls out of you.Anthony Rawlings, Tony, Anton, Mr. Rawlings....no matter what you call this man, he will wreck you. He will make you hate him. He will make you feel sorry for him, and he will make you love him. This will go on and on, until you don't know what to think. No matter what you feel for him, the point is...you will FEEL.&#10077;She was his drug. Claire Nichols ran through his system like ecstasy, sending him on otherwise unobtainable highs.&#10078;In Behind His Eyes - Truth, Tony finally has to deal with circumstances beyond his control. That's not to say he won't try, but it's out of his reach. Conflicting feelings turn into clarity, and then to opportunity. Every little detail has it's reasoning. There are scenes that you appreciate getting a second look at. Maybe you will get some answers to some questions that have been on your mind. Maybe it will make you even more confused. No matter what, we get to see the two characters that we have fallen for happy again, even if for a moment in time. I'm pretty sure I said this in my last review of BHE - Consequences, but if you are an avid reader of this series, even though you know what's going to happen, it is still so **** intense!I could seriously go on and on about Tony. He is so incredibly fascinating. Some of you while reading this will have little smirks on your face at times. We get to witness Tony without control. He always has such an internal conflict when it comes to his Claire. The depth of his feelings for Claire is beautiful, yet a little scary, but it's nice to bare witness to such a gruff man come to terms with his love for another human being. For such a powerful man he has so many regrets. It's a little sick that I find some comfort in his suffering, but it reminds us that he is just a man.&#10077;He didn't want to be disappointed; however, more than that, he didn't want to disappoint.&#10078;So make sure you pour yourself a glass of wine, shot of tequila, or a whiskey sour, because this will take a lot out of you. Nobody can write intensity like Aleatha Romig. She is so high at the top of her game right now, I can't wait to get the final chapter in this saga. Here is to another fantastic addition to the Consequences Series, and here is to the man we all love to hate, Mr. Anthony Rawlings.*Gifted Copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*\", \"Vivid characters and descriptions. The author has created a tale that grabs your attention and I couldn't put it down.\", \"I've read most of the other books in the Coffee Shop series, and I was thrilled to see this new full length arrival. Beth and Gabriel's story continues in this action packed erotic romance, with all the emotional twists and outside surprises Towers is known for.The book opens with Beth trying to adjust to her new life as the billionaire's girl. It's a strange, wonderful world filled with incredible luxuries that would make any waitress' eyes pop. The lavish socials and high powered business dealings that are normal for Gabriel are a complete shock to Beth, and she struggles to integrate into his world. Of course, it helps to have tall, dark, and handsome making things a little easier for her, with plenty of moments to blow off steam.As in most Towers romances, outside forces try to come in and disrupt the happy couple. This book has plenty of wild intrusions, schemes, and deadly misunderstandings that left me guessing until the joyous end!The little things in this novel brought a smile to my face as well. A couple characters from her other books make cameos in this novel. Then there are the genuinely heartfelt moments between Beth and the billionaire where it seems nothing could ever tear them apart, even when it feels like the whole world is aligned against them.If you like your romances HOT with a little mystery and a strong Coming of Age element, then this book is for you!\", \"Source: Received an e-ARC via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.I had heard good things about this author's previous book Breaking Beautiful so I decided to go for it and check out her latest to see if I'd want to circle back and read the other one. Based on the plot and writing of this one, I would be willing to check out the first book from the library. I can't say I was head over heels in love to want to buy it.Jaycee missed the last text of her best friend Rachel's life, caught up in her first kiss and lingering anger from a fight between the girls six months previously. This haunts her as she starts to believe there was more to Rachel's death than is being shared and confirmed when she receives unlikely aid from a friend of Rachel's, sending her down a path of gangs, hazing initiations, jealousy, and racial tensions in a small insular Washington town.For me, this book's big strength was its fast-paced. I read it all in one frantic day, barely able to put it down as each chapter only impelled me to read further. I credit this to the writing and plotting of Wolf-she really kept me on the edge of my seat.Also of interest was peeling back the layers of racism and mistrust between the old timers of the small town and the migrant workers, some of whom may be there illegally. When Rachel is murdered, it is all too easy to lay the blame at the feet of someone who allegedly has ties to a gang or whose skin is a different color from yours. I'm not sure this was handled as thoroughly as it could have been but it might be enlightening for some people and it helped to ratchet up the tension in the beginning of the book.But its weakness for me was its timid and naive narrator, though as the book progresses the reader gets a sense of her strong moral fortitude. I guess you could compare her to Fanny Price of Mansfield Park. She lives within her father's stringent rules and doesn't try to push the bounds of what it means to be a good girl, accepting her fate as one of the uncool. But her best friend considers her the best person she knows, someone who knows right from wrong and will diligently work to expose the truth and render justice (not vengeance, a key distinction). Saying that, even as I admire those kinds of people, they don't tend to be my favorite book characters. I like a bit more flamboyance and wit a la Elizabeth Bennet. The naivety is especially frustrating when it came to the culprit; I started having my suspicions probably later than others but it was eons before Jaycee with her trusting heart.Overall: I am eager to hear the opinion of people who have read Wolf's previous outing as well as those who are well-versed in YA mystery/thrillers. How do you think this stacks up? Personally I think this is a can-miss. Give it a read if the concept sounds intriguing to you but otherwise, don't feel bad about passing over it.\", \"I loved this books. I have read four of the Sea Breeze Books now. Each one of them keeps getting better and better. I loved Preston and Amanda's story line. Love Abbi Glines writing she is a great writer, she knows how to bring a storyline to life. Wish she would write a sequel to this one.\", \"Tracy Holczer's The Secret Hum of a Daisy is the type of novel I devour, then want to begin all over again. This book is so much more than just the story that Holczer has written.  It is an absolutely beautiful book, full of wisdom and sadness, and hope.Grace is twelve years old when her mother dies in an accident. It has always been just the two of them against the world. Grace's father died before she was born, and although she knows she has a grandmother out there somewhere, she has never met her.  Grace's mom and grandma didn't see eye to eye on things when Grace's mom was pregnant with her, and she left town, never returning.  The two move often, not really allowing themselves to settle in any one town.But now that her mom has passed away, Grace is being sent to live with her grandmother, a woman that she is sure she is not supposed to like.  Her grandmother's life feels far from the one she was accustomed to living with her mom.Grace continues to want to live in the Before....before the accident, not the After.  Her grief is still new, and as she tries to mourn the loss of her mother, she is also adjusting to a new school and her grandmother, who doesn't seem nearly as horrible as she anticipated.Grace learns a lot about life and about love and about moving on.  Holczer's novel is so beautifully written.  There is an important message within this story, and although I just finished reading this myself, would love to start over again so I can enjoy the wisdom that is imparted in its pages.This is a novel I will be recommending to everyone from my middle grade readers to my adult friends.  I'm hoping The Secret Hum of a Daisy is on everyone's mind come Newbery time.\", \"Devoured this book in one day.

Keep it coming!', 'Very simple book, but leaves you feeling good.  No over the top sex scenes, no graphic violence.  Just a simple book that talks touches on child abuse and dysfunction in a family.  I liked it because the author did not go into graphic detail about the abuse, but instead focused how it affected the people involved.  Good story, good characters.', \"This story started off a little slow for me and at times the dialogue was a little stiff, making it almost seem forced. The further I read the more interesting and natural the story became. I loved the brothers and roommates in their own ways but I had a particular fondness for George and the prank wars between him and Kyle. Dean seemed like he was just trying to look out for Kyle but in doing so he didn't leave a lot of room for her to make her own decisions and I think it was actually doing more harm than good.I still have questions about the night that Kyle regrets the most in her life it just seemed liked we didn't get a lot of details of the aftermath or in fact the aftermath wasn't as serious as it seemed to be to affect Kyle in such a strong way. I was also a little confused about her family's reaction to Nick. One minute it seemed like they wanted her to stay away from him and the next it was like they just wanted her to move on from her previous relationship and get a boyfriends already.I loved Kyle but frankly he's still sort of a mystery to me. He's totally swoonworthy, I mean really a British accent, yes please. He is also patient and kind but persistent in his efforts to make Kyle understand how much he cares about her.Now can we talk about the last chapter and the ending? I have so many questions about Nick's sudden 360, what happened, what's going on? Then the way the book ended, say what? I was not expecting that at all and now I'm biting my nails to find out what happens next.Over all I think this was a great debut and I could see the growth of the author from the beginning to the end of the book. I look forward to what she brings us in the next installment.*I received an ARC from the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review\", \"This book was so good.  D. Scott did not disappoint!

Dee Dee Scott definitely has me needing for more.\", 'First thoughts - loved it, another fascinating universe with more great characters.Hunter&#8217;s Claim, a post-apocalyptic (zombie free) romance with sexy aliens, grabs your attention from page one and doesn&#8217;t let go.The heroine Jesse and her sisters are smart, resourceful and loyal. Once they decide you&#8217;re family, watch out. Jesse&#8217;s determination to do the right thing is admirable and brings her the trouble and reward that she deserves.The hero Hunter and his friends are the sexy alpha men that are just a bit clueless with regard to interacting with strong, independent Earth women.The story moves along quickly and is over before you&#8217;re ready, forcing a re-read if you don&#8217;t want to let the characters go yet.No cliffhanger but, as with most SE Smith stories, several characters now need their stories told.Disclaimer &#8211; definitely a SE Smith fan girl, haven&#8217;t read a story of hers that I didn&#8217;t like.Cross-posted amazon, goodreads, shelfari&#8230;', \"I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end.

Her wonderful characters, K9 Police Officer, Chris Bergstrom, and \"trust baby\" Sarah Pullman are well drawn.  Both women have troubled backgrounds, Chris from her \"life is black or white\" military family, and Sarah from her pretentious social climbing family.  Their touching meeting over the blackberries at a Whole Foods Market, was beautifully and tenderly written.  What follows is one of California\\'s horrific fire seasons, with great descriptions, as well as a threat to the wild life shelter where Sarah volunteers.  This emergency causes  heroic acts by the volunteers at the shelter and police officers to get the animals to safety.  The scene with the baboons in the back of the squad cars was priceless!  \"They could s***, you know\".  Chris responding, \"so do the criminals.\"There are dark moments for both of these characters, but that is balanced by lightness from the great sense of humor each woman has.  Readers also get a great inside look at some of the \\'hidden\\' spots in L.A.  This is another good story by a fine writer.', 'Love this book. Detailed and easy to follow instructions.

These ideas really never get a chance to blossom before she's on to the next one leaving the reader confused as to what is going on and more importantly why. This has been one of my complaints with this series is that it seems to be over as soon as its begun.

Like water, we mostly follow the path of least resistance.&#8221;Seeing as Wally Lamb is my favorite author I was extra excited to read this book. It definitely did not disappoint. On the surface, this is a story of a broken marriage. Of a wife and mother of three who leaves her husband for another woman. If you have read some of his previous works, you already know that there is going to be so much more to the story. Pour yourself a large glass of red wine and keep the bottle nearbyThere are so many heavy issues that are dealt with in this story, divorce, sexual abuse, loss of a parent, alcoholism, the list goes on. I know this makes it sound like a depressing story but it&#8217;s not all bad. The real heart of the story is learning to cope with what life has given you and making the most of it. Buy another bottle of wine.The thing I love the most about his novels is the way everything is so layered. You have to pay attention to things that may seem insignificant at the time as it will certainly come full circle in the end. There is always some intertwined story that seems to not have anything to do with the rest until the end. This is not to say that everything gets tied up and placed in a nice package with a bow on it. Many things are just inferred and if you haven&#8217;t been paying attention you will miss out on these gifts.Annie Oh is an artist, a mother, and an ex wife and is about to be remarried. To a woman. Her husband Orion is left to deal with not only being left but being left for another woman. Their children are also forced to deal with aftermath of her decisions. Annie also has secrets from her childhood that have shaped everything she has ever done in her adult life. Things she has never shared with anyone. Not even her husband or her soon to be wife. Of course this only begins to scratch the surface of the entire plot of the story.This novel reminds me of the concept of the butterfly effect. One small action effects so many things. It is not until the end that we learn what started everything. I can honestly say there is not one thing I disliked about this story.

The story never gets old. Another great book from Danielle Steel', \"This book seems to create strong feelings in all who read it. It certainly came to me highly recommended. My husband and I read this book along with the companion workbook with 4 other couples, and it was and arduous journey. For our group of Christian couples in happy marriages, there was just too much that did not apply to us. Sure, we each picked up a handy tip here and there, but it wasn't enough considering the length and repetitiveness of this book.I agree with the basis of Eggerichs' main point in this book: If she gets the love she needs, she will give him the respect he needs, which will cause him to give her the love she needs. You get it - it's the cycle of love and respect. I gave it to you in one sentence instead of 24 chapters. If this book was about a third the length, I probably would have rated it at least 1-star higher.Every time our group met after the first time, we felt like we were struggling to get something new out of what we had read. The workbook is even worse. The questions are extremely verbose restatements of what is already written in the chapters, and there are a lot of them. Each couple would need to invest a couple of hours into each session, only to feel like we were trudging through the same material each time.We were also disappointed by the lack of scriptural references. Though the book is loosely based on Ephesians 5, the author rarely includes scripture in the chapters and more often uses letters from happy Love & Respect retreat participants as teaching tools. Our group was hoping for more Biblical discussion than what we got.If your marriage needs work and you and your spouse have trouble supporting each other and understanding each other's point of view, this book may help you. If you are looking for a good small group discussion book for a group of happily married couples, I would urge you to pass. In fact, run away.\", 'Beautifully written, this story brings hope to everyone struggling with a less than perfect life during the difficult holiday season.', 'Phone calls in the middle of the night are almost never good news, but Isa isn&#8217;t to worried after she discovers the caller is her cousin and good friend Alette.

This one is talky and overlong.  Every chapter seems to end with some variation of the line, '... and then we'd find the Panther.  And one of us would die.'  And there are 83 chapters.  I thought we were being set up for some alternate ending in which this did not happen, but DeMille is not John LeCarre (thankfully).  But the actual ending isn't all that satisfying.The author takes a shot at fleshing out the bad guy character early on, which was interesting, but then he just drops it and becomes repetitive.  The closer-to-home bad guy is a walking cliche.  John Corey's capacity to just be a plain jackass has grown beyond amusing here, and Kate Mayfield is given almost nothing to do.Almost all the action is packed into the last few chapters, and then, just when things got rolling, a sudden ending that wasn't worth the previous 500+ pages, basically reading about meetings.  The ending seems to leave open the possibility of a sequel, which could pit John Corey against one of his teammates from this book, whom he would secretly want to succeed.  Probably woouldn't be great.If you like this kind of stuff, and have already read the first four John Corey books, read any of the Sean Drummond books by Brian Haig instead.

I know folks who think highly of the series, so maybe my impression of this book -- a prequel to that series -- would've been more favorable if I had more familiarity with the other Rain books.It's not that I think this is a bad book; I just don't know if I see anything here that I can't get elsewhere -- except for the throwback Japanese setting, which was pretty well drawn.Another reviewer said that Rain is kind of like an Asian Reacher, and I think that's probably true (although with this book, Rain is a young man and not as experienced as Reacher is or as Rain himself is in the other novels).If you like Reacher-style narratives but would fancy a change of setting, give this series a try. I probably will. I'm just not sure this particular book is where to start.\", \"Never Been Ready is book 2 in the Ready series by J.L. Berg.  This is Leah and Declan's story.  Both of whom were introduced in When You're Ready.  If you recall Leah is Clare's best friend and a nurse at the hospital where Logan, Clare's new husband works.  Declan is a famous movie star and one of Logan's college buddies.  Leah and Declan have a one night stand in book 1 and book 2 pretty much starts a few months later.I'm not going to rehash the entire book or reword the synopsis.  I am going to tell you right off the bat that overall I thought this was a decent story.  Was it as good as book 1?  In my opinion, no, and I hope to tell you why I did and didn't like it.I thought the characters in Never Been Ready were well developed.  We get lots of insight on both Declan and Leah's upbringing as well as who they are as adults.  We learn what makes them tick, what makes the love and what makes them laugh.  Declan and Leah together on the pages are hot and steamy as well as light and fun.  There are even some poignant moments.  Those poignant moments are what I think J.L. Berg is really good at writing.I loved all the moments with Clare and Logan.  I missed them and I was super happy to have them back.  I also appreciated the introduction of Clare's brother, Garrett.  There were many obvious moments in the book where Garrett was being set up for book 3 in the series, Ready For You.This is the tricky part for me.  How to explain what I didn't like.  The only word that keeps coming to mind is lackluster.The premise of the story was good.  Leah's childhood plays an important role.  Logan's childhood as well is integral.  The way their two lives ultimately intersect is also really important and was well thought out.  There was even a shocking moment that gave me goosebumps.  Goosebumps are always good!!  I just felt like the journey to get to the good stuff felt forced and quick.  For instance there is a certain scene between an actress and Leah at an awards show.  I felt like that particular moment had absolutely no bearing on the story as a whole.  The story wasn't really about Declan as an actor and whether or not Leah could handle it.  There was also a scene near the end involving Leah's father.  It may have been an attempt to tie up loose ends.  Maybe even an attempt to open Leah and Declan's eyes.  Again, I thought it was unnecessary.  The story would have been good without it.  I didn't think Leah needed that closure.  I didn't think Declan needed that push.I felt this story had a much deeper meaning than a hollywood actor who sweeps a woman from an abusive home, off on a whirlwind relationship.  It was about two people broken and bruised by their parents, being able to come together as a couple and finding their way towards a future with each other.  It was about embracing the future and accepting what's in front of you.  Accepting who you are, what you're capable of and what you can offer someone in return.  This was a story about love, forgiveness, and hope.For as many times as I rubbed my eyes and scratched my head in frustration, I was however, also rewarded with those special moments.  This is where I love J.L. Berg's writing, there is so much potential here.&#34;But that kiss?  That kiss left me awe-struck.  It was earth-shattering in its simplicity, mind-numbing in its intimacy, and completely raw in its emotional depths.&#34; - LeahSigh....see?  That's beautiful right there.  Give me more of that and less fluff.  It's okay to have lots of angst, inter-mingled with funny and lighthearted moments, while still being able to give us beautiful lines.  I don't mind the insights into each others worlds.  On the contrary those are important for character development.  It's the other stuff, like the moment with the actress, or the box that Declan takes from the attic of Leah's childhood home, that doesn't reappear again until nearly the end of the book.&#34;Shit.  I'm going to cry again.  Why do I cry so much around you?&#34;&#34;I don't know, but I'll hold you every time you do.&#34;I remember when I read that part I had to stop and smile at my husband because that's something he would say to me.  Those are the moments I like to look for my stories.  The stuff I can relate to or dream about or swoon over.  There is a really good story here in Never Been Ready, it just didn't come together for me as a complete package.Should you read this book?  Absolutely.  It might not be my favorite but it's still a decent read.  I'm looking forward to learning more about Garrett in book 3.*A copy of this book was kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*\", 'In the spring of 1956, when I was 12 1/2 years old, living in Queens, and finishing the 7th grade (just like Herbie), my parents bought Herman Wouk\\'s \"Marjorie Morningstar,\" and I started reading it.  I found it a bit ponderous, at least for my 12-year-old taste, and my parents thought it might be too \"mature\" for a little kid.  So my mother went to our local library and borrowed \"City Boy,\" telling me I\\'d love it.She was absolutely right, although I took umbrage at identifying myself as a \"Herbie.\"  Unlike the book\\'s protagonist, I was big and strong for my age and a decent athlete who could hit a baseball a mile (catching it was a different story) and who could take care of himself, so I tried to think of myself as a \"Lennie\" (the big, dumb kid who was Herbie\\'s rival) although I found his character a bit repulsive, as he was a bully and I (generally) wasn\\'t. I paid little attention to the subplot involving Lucille Glass (I wasn\\'t yet interested in girls), and even less to that involving the attempted buyout of \"The Place,\" the ice factory co-owned by Herbie and Lennie\\'s fathers, and by a silent partner, Mr. Powers.  The following year, I went to a sleepaway camp much like Camp Manitou, and with my bunkmates at Bunk 9, put a few of Herbie\\'s ideas into play.  By that time my interest in the opposite sex started to manifest itself.  Did it ever.Recently I bought \"City Boy\" along with \"The Caine Mutiny\" and \"Marjorie Morningstar\" (which my wife is reading for the second time), and I\\'ve come to the conclusion that despite the fact that I could hit a spaldeen 3 sewers as a kid, I was very much a Herbie, then and now, who would soon develop his hopeless crush on his very own Lucille Glass -- actually two of them--sequentially and many years separated, both of whom I met at yet another summer camp.  (One of the two even grew up in the Bronx, not all that far in distance from Mosholu Parkway where Lucille lived but light-years away demographically and culturally.)Like Herbie, I was that lad who would ride in the front car of the subway with his buddies, noses pressed up against the glass by the motorman\\'s cab as we watched the train fly through the tunnel as we headed towards Ebbets Field in Brooklyn where we would emerge into dazzling sunlight at the Prospect Park station to watch the immortal Duke blast frozen ropes onto Bedford Avenue before the great No. 4 and the other Dodgers would desert us for the purported Sybaritic paradise of La-la Land.  The crushes would come a couple years later, and last forever.  I suspect Herbie, now 97, still has a thing for 96-year-old Lucille.Let\\'s briefly summarize the plot:  1928. Herbie Bookbinder, a precocious and manipulative 11-year-old a year ahead of his class in school, develops a crush on a little girl, Lucille Glass, a grade behind him.  Lucille tells Herbie she\\'s going to attend Camp Manitou, a kid\\'s summer camp in the Berkshires run by Mr. Gauss, the school\\'s principal.  Herbie wheedles his parents into letting him go there.  Also attending will be Lennie Krieger, a lunkheaded 13-year-old who\\'s a year behind his class, and about to be left back again. Herbie\\'s father and Lennie\\'s father are co-owners of an ice-making business called \"The Place,, and there\\'s an Irish silent partner named Powers who may or may not own a controlling interest in the business, and who wants to sell it to a third party so he can cover some bad outside investments.  Lucille\\'s father is an attorney who represents the business, but seems to represent Powers more than the other two partners.Herbie gets to camp, and quickly learns it\\'s no paradise; \"Uncle\" Gauss is far more interested in turning a profit by cutting corners than in molding childrens\\' characters.  Moreover, Herbie\\'s a lousy athlete, and is taunted by the older boys, with the bullying led by Lennie.  Herbie, in an effort to impress Lucille, wants to build an amusement park-type ride for the camp\\'s Mardi Gras Day, but the materials to build it will cost $50 (equivalent to $1,000 today) which he doesn\\'t have.  How to get the money?  Steal it from his dad\\'s safe (Herbie knows the combination); then leave a promissory note guaranteeing repayment.  In an mad series of adventures, Herbie and his cousin Cliff sneak out of camp, hitchhike the 100 miles back to the Bronx in the middle of the night, only to find Mr. Bookbinder and his partners engaged in an acrimonious discussion about selling off the company.  When the men are somehow distracted, Herbie and Cliff steal $50 from the thousands in the safe, hightail it out of there, and hitch back to Camp Manitou before reveille the next morning, without anyone noticing.  Herbie, assisted by Cliff, a broken-down horse, and the camp\\'s handyman, who turns out to be Herbie\\'s mentor, builds his ride. It\\'s a big success, making far more than the $50 cost of materials, and most important, Herbie finally impresses the \"fickle\" Lucille.  But Herbie\\'s troubles are only beginning, and the conclusion of the story brings the three legs of the plot together.One thing I really liked was that Herbie and his pals navigated the NYC subway system by themselves at age 11, just as I did back in the \\'50\\'s.  NYC, including the subways, has become as safe as it was 55 years ago, but most parents think it\\'s still 1990 and riding the subway is as dangerous as being in Afghanistan.  Today, if an 11-year-old is seen riding the subway, Child Protective Services will accuse his parents of neglect.  Another thing that I totally agreed with was that Wouk, without explicitly saying so, is opposed to smart kids skipping grades.  Herbie was 1 1/2 years ahead intellectually, but socially and physically he was still only 11, which is especially troublesome for boys.  Fortunately, the NYC school system has largely abandoned this.In conclusion, I found the story far more entertaining as an adult than I did as a child, and I loved it back then.  Yet I can\\'t give it 5 stars, as much as I\\'d like to, because Wouk is overly on-the-nose in drumming the story\\'s moral - the ends don\\'t justify the means - into the innocent and not-so-innocent readers.  In the Caine Mutiny, where there are more than 50 shades of grey to describe the characters of the ensemble cast (including Lt. Commander Queeq), Wouk lets their actions do the moralizing, rather than editorialize. That said, I whole-heartedly recommend this for children of all ages, and would grade this 4 1/2 stars if I could.', 'Clara life was in a rut and all the dreams of making a difference were  lost in a going nowhere job and a boring couch potato life.

Even though I am not quite finished with this book, and still have a few pages remaining, I wanted to go ahead and write the review because I have learned and enjoyed so much during its reading. In fact, as soon as I am done writing this review, I am going to go finish the book.I grew up in a home, church, and social circle that viewed all forms of alcohol as ... well... evil. When it was mentioned that someone was drinking or that someone drank occasionally or socially, it was absolutely appalling. I am not sure how much of this was because of actuality or because of my perceptions of the situations where drinking was encountered, but it was a definite no-no to drink in any way, shape, or form.When I got older, I began encountering people that caused my views to conflict with the reality around me... in other words, I was meeting people who were clearly steadfast Christians, but they would drink occasionally or socially. My worldview didn't allow for this. In fact, many of the drinkers that I met were by far more dedicated to the cause of the gospel than the teetotalers that I had known. So I did what any good Christian would do... I shunned them and ignored these conflicting worldviews. WAIT! NO! I went to the Bible to determine the truth! What I found was quite different than what I had &#34;known&#34; growing up. My views needed adjusting.When I eventually encountered Drinking With Calvin and Luther!: A History of Alcohol in the Church by Jim West, which was a Christmas gift from my wife, my views had shifted appropriately and were fairly solid now on what the Bible actually teaches concerning alcohol, but were still hazy on the practicality of these new views. This book served to solidify those views, and give me direction on how to practically apply those views. It is a very Biblical book, but what was absolutely surprising to me was the actual history of alcohol in the church, which this book does an absolutely amazing job of bringing to light.I have a great respect for church history. I believe that it is important what Christians have believed historically. This is why I am a big supporter of reading and learning from historical documents, creeds, and books. Like Paul writing to Timothy, I am often saying, &#34;Don't forget to bring my scrolls!&#34; (2 Timothy 4:13) ... well for me ... &#34;books!&#34;  I mean, really, who am I, or who are we to believe that the last 2000 years Christians have gotten  it wrong? In fact, tracing the beliefs that have stuck can be extraordinarily enlightening. The amount of historical information and quotes that Jim West shares from remembered and respected Christian leaders through the ages was extraordinary. It never felt cumbersome reading this book, but I did find myself often wanting to quote different portions of this book. Especially those encounters with quotes from Martin Luther, like:&#34;Do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by destroying the object which is abused. Men can go wrong with wine and women. Shall we then prohibit and abolish women?&#34;~Martin LutherJim West also confronted the different teachings of the prohibitionist's views by going directly to the scripture. He displayed an amazing knowledge of the topic from the historical, the Biblical, and even the opposing view points. If you are actually interested in learning what the Bible teaches concerning alcohol, then I recommend this book. If you want to learn the Church's historical stance concerning alcohol, then I highly recommend this book.I would like to point out in advance, as a Pastor myself, that there were many members of the clergy, through the ages, that were paid ... not just monetarily, but with kegs of beer for the purpose of entertaining.

This makes it tempting to take inspiration from people we actually know. But this Fantastic book does everything for you!

They rushed to his beside when they found out he was in a coma, brought in some phenomenal specialist doctor to work with him, then just peaced out and were never heard from again. Emma didn't bother to inform him that they had been there, nor did he bother to ask, and also, nobody bothered to even freakin' tell them that he was awake and at home, and his parents didn't even bother to so much as call to check on him either!!4) Emma was harboring so much hurt & resentment towards William through most of the book, and then *BAM* like the flip of a switch she's.over.it.and.they're.getting.married.THE.END there was no actual working through her hurt, no communication, openness, honesty. So now they got their &#34;HEA&#34; that seems doomed because their whole relationship is based on lies & deceit between 2 people who are trying too hard to be what they think that the other wants, rather than being who they really are.With all that being said, the series was good, and had TONS of potential for greatness, but the last 2 books were just too rushed and had too many holes in the plot.Also, I would have very much preferred to read the 2 books together, just written as 1 book, done in alternating POV's.Wow, that was really long winded, if you've stuck it out and are still reading this, thank you!\", \"I enjoyed reading this book.  I'm switching between reading light, happy books for a bit, and one heavy book. I loved the characters and their thoughts and actions. I would like to read this whole series, and wish this were a real place that I could go visit.\", \"Princess Ashling is excited to see her father, thinking he is going to brand her to make her officially part of the pack.  But when Ashling and her mother get there they learn that he intends to marry her off, even though she is only 14.  Ashling and her mother protest, but it is Ashling's brother who persuades their father to let Ashling wait a few more years before she is to be married to her intended.  A few years pass and Ashling and her mother are found by their pack's enemy.  They run back to her father for protection and it's decided that Ashling should go into hiding with Baran, a sort of lone wolf.  While living with him she meets Grey.  He's not a werewolf but there is something about him that she can't put her finger on, plus she is very interested in him.  Grey reciprocates the attraction, but many obstacles stand in the way of their happy ever after.This story started out great and kept me interested.  It's definitely unique compared to other werewolf stories I've read.  I was a little turned off that Ashling was only 14 at first; I thought I was going to have to read about a 14 year old, but then in the next chapter, a few years pass, so that was good news for me.Ashling is a headstrong female.  She doesn't let anyone, including her father tie her down.  Basically, she does what she wants.  She had great character traits, but I still had a little trouble feeling connected to her.Let's talk about chemistry between Ashling and Grey.  I could tell the attraction was immediate; but for the rest of their relationship I just felt like something was missing.  I can't put my finger on it though.  I honestly didn't care if they were together or not.  I didn't feel the love as much as they were saying it to each other.The story kept me very interested in the beginning, then I did get a little bored towards the middle, but the ending picked up again and I really couldn't put it down.  All in all, Bloodmark was a good book.  And the bonus is that it's the first book of a series.  The ending got a lot more interesting to me, and I think the second book is going to be even better.My Rating:  3 1/2 out of 5 stars~Pam*****I received this book free from the author, in exchange for an honest review.*****\", \"Cambria Hebert is an author that I wait anxiously for her next book, knowing I will love it and Tattoo, does not disappoint. I loved her novel, Text, and this reminds me a lot of that book due to the suspense and immediate chemistry between the male and female lead. Brody, a cop coming from years undercover, is rusty at following his emotions. Taylor, an unspoiled beauty, determined to see under his facade. The story starts out with a bang and the action doesn't stop. As with all of her writings, it is well written, great dialog, fast paced, and pulls you in immediately! Cambria - Text was my favorite, but Tattoo gives it a run for its money!\", 'Good book, lots of turns and interesting subject Harlan coben recreates new characters to his stories which blend into his subjects', 'my second copy, well written, everyone needs to read it to see and understand what we believeto be truth or tradition', \"It appears to be a fatal single car accident until Claire takes a closer look and determines that it might have been a small bomb instead.  Lindsay gets the case, but the FBI quickly take it from her.  Still, she and Richie investigate, but they are finding so few clues.  Will the bomber strike again?Meantime, the FBI has also spotted Mackie Morales, the one who got away.  Cindy becomes obsessed with tracking this psychopath down, with the help of cops, to conduct an interview.  And Yuki is getting married, but her joy might quickly turn to sorrow&#8230;.This series is wildly uneven, but this is definitely one of the better books.  While Claire doesn't wind up with much to do, there are still three storylines that kept me turning pages quickly to find out what would happen next in all of them.  Unfortunately, three plots takes its toll again, and one of them gets short shifted in the climax.  Additionally, the character development is a little shallow.  Still, it was a fun, fast read.Fans of the series will delight to spend time with these ladies.  This is a definite step up from the previous entry.\", \"Loved this book! This book speaks life on so many levels! Nivea and Von are a hot mess!!! Glad I got this on a and can't wait for them next part to this series...the things that go on in this circle is unbelievable!!! Excellent read, I suggest thus book to anyone who wants to be pleased! Bravo 10x\", \"I have always enjoyed Amy Tan's unique style of writing. This book was good but a little long- it almost lost my interest.\", 'I would like anyone that loves to read know this series is wonderful. I have enjoyed everyone so far and looking forward to the rest.', 'My wife recommended this book and she was spot on. The characters--both men & women--are varied and interesting. The world of the homeless young person is illuminated with several vivid stories, and one finds many of the characters realistic and appealing.']\n['POSITIVE', 'NEGATIVE', 'POSITIVE', 'NEGATIVE',
